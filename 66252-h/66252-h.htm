<p>A residence of ten years in Ticonderoga inspired me with an
appreciation of the history of that most historic spot in America,
and when as secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical Society I
was instrumental in securing the erection of the Black Watch
Memorial in that village, I became particularly interested in the
record of that famous Highland Regiment which this building commemorates.</p>

<p>It has for several years been my wish to write so complete an
account of the Black Watch at Ticonderoga that one would need
look in no other place for any detail in the history of that regiment
from the time it left Scotland in 1756 until after the capture
of Ticonderoga by Amherst in 1759. As a meeting of the New York
State Historical Association on Lake Champlain seemed an appropriate
time to present such a paper and the printed histories of
that period give only meagre accounts on this subject, Mrs. Richards
and I made this an excuse for a trip to the British Isles and
a large part of August and September, 1910, was spent on a Black
Watch pilgrimage. We had a very enjoyable trip and gained many
interesting facts but I am sorry to say that the story is still far
from complete.</p>

<p>The reason for the lack of more detailed information about the
Regiment in the Ticonderoga period is found in the following which
is copied from the preface of Stewart of Garth’s first edition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The origin of these Sketches and Military Details was simply
this: When the Forty-second regiment was removed from Dublin
to Donaghadee in the year 1771, the baggage was sent round by
sea. The vessel having it on board was unfortunately driven on
shore by a gale of wind, and wrecked; the greater part of the cargo
and baggage was lost, and the portion saved, especially the regimental
books and records, was much injured. A misfortune somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
similar occurred, when the army, under the Earl of Moira,
landed at Ostend in June, 1794. The transports were ordered
round to Helvoetsluys, with orders to wait the further movements
of the troops. But the vessels had not been long there, when the
enemy invaded Holland in great force, and, entering Helvoetsluys,
seized on the transports in the harbour. Among the number of
vessels taken were those which had conveyed the Forty-second to
Flanders, having on board every article of regimental baggage,
except the knapsacks with which the officers and soldiers had
landed at Ostend in light marching order. Along with the baggage,
a well-selected library, and, what was more to be regretted, all that
remained of the historical records of the regiment, from the period
of its formation till the year 1793, fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>“After the conclusion of the late war, his Royal Highness, the
Commander-in-Chief, directed that the Forty-second should draw
up a record of its services and enter it in the regimental books, for
the information of those who should afterwards belong to the
corps. As none of the officers who had served previously to the
loss of the records in 1794 were then in the regiment, some difficulty
arose in drawing up the required statement of service; indeed,
to do so correctly was found impossible, as, for a period of fifty-four
years previous to 1793, the materials were very defective. In
this situation, the commanding officer, in the year 1817, requested
me to supply him with a few notices on the subject.”</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed to have been the custom in the British army of that
period for a Regiment to carry its entire belongings with it from
place to place and this unfortunate practice has swept from existence
every trace of the Regimental records of the Black Watch of
Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>It may be readily seen that if Colonel Stewart who had all the
information in 1817 which the British government was able to
supply and who was also fortunate in having had an intimate
acquaintance during his service in the Regiment with officers who
have served almost from its formation, was unable to write a complete
record, the task nearly one hundred years later might be
considered well nigh hopeless. There was the hope, however, that
some record which was then lost might have been discovered since
Colonel Stewart’s time or that interesting matter might be found in
the archives of the families who had sons in the Black Watch of
1758. It is a fact that only recently the regimental records of the
Black Watch of two decades later were found in an old second-hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
book store in Portsmouth and it is still possible that the regimental
records of 1758-9, which are now lost, may yet come to light.</p>

<p>We find that nearly all the histories of the Highland Regiments
follow Stewart of Garth nearly word for word in their accounts of
the early history of the Black Watch. A notable exception, however,
is “A Military History of Perthshire,” which has much
that is new. There are also many interesting letters and other
records in “The Chronicles of the Atholl and Tullibardine Families,”
relating to the service of those of the Black Watch who came
from the Atholl Family or estate, and at London we found some
dispatches in the Public Record Office in the War Department
which I have not seen published. The chief merit, however, if any,
which I can claim for this address is that while it does not add
much that is new, it does, I think, collect in one article nearly all
that is known about the Black Watch of the Ticonderoga period.</p>

<p>I might say here, also, that whatever was lacking in information
was more than made up by the cordiality of our reception,
as we found nearly every Scotsman interested in the oldest
Highland Regiment of the British Army and glad to help us in any
way possible. We are under special obligation, which I here wish
to acknowledge, to Lt. Col. Hugh Rose, the present commander
of the First Battalion of the Black Watch; Major D. L. Wilson
Farquharson, D. S. O., who represented the Regiment at the unveiling
of the memorial tablet at Ticonderoga, July 4, 1906, now
retired and living in Allargue in Aberdeenshire, the home of the
Farquharson’s for many generations; W. Skeoch Cumming of Edinburgh,
artist and authority on Scottish costumes and tartans of the
18th century; Mrs. Campbell of Dunstaffnage, present owner of
old Inverawe House; the Marchioness of Tullibardine, editor of
“A Military History of Perthshire,” and the Duke of Atholl, present
head of the Clan Murray, Honorary Colonel of the Third Battalion
of the Black Watch and compiler of the “Chronicles of the Atholl
and Tullibardine Families.”</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the Black Watch of Ticonderoga, it would
perhaps be well to give a brief history of the Regiment. There is
considerable difference of opinion as to just when the independent
companies which were afterwards to become the present regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of the line were raised. The earliest record I have seen is that on
the 3rd of August, 1667, King Charles II issued a commission under
the Great Seal to John, second Earl of Atholl “to raise and keep
such a number of men as he should think fit to be a constant guard
for securing the peace in the Highlands” and “to watch upon the
braes.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>From this time until 1739 the Black Watch was in various
stages of formation.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It was at the period of the independent companies that the
name Black Watch was given&mdash;Black from the sombre tartan in
contrast to the regular soldiers who at that time had coats, waistcoats
and breeches of scarlet cloth, and Watch because their duties
were to watch or keep order in the Highlands. The character of
the rank and file of the Black Watch of this period was exceedingly
high, many gentlemen with servants serving as privates, and in
addition to the enlistment being from the best families it was also
possible to select only “men of full height, well proportioned and
of handsome appearance.” There were several reasons for this, the
principal one being probably the fact that at that period the carrying
of arms was prohibited by penalties and it became an “object
of ambition with all the young men of spirit to be admitted even
as privates into a service which gave them the privilege of wearing
arms.” Our interest in the Black Watch, however, is principally
in the Regiment of the line as such and this dates from the commission
given by George II, October 25, 1739, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“GEORGE R.&mdash;Whereas we have thought fit, that a regiment
of foot be forthwith formed under your command, and to consist
of ten companies, each to contain one captain, one lieutenant, one
ensign, three serjeants, three corporals, two drummers, and one
hundred effective private men; which said regiment shall be partly
formed out of six Independent Companies of Foot in the Highlands
of North Britain, three of which are now commanded by
captains, and three by captain-lieutenants. Our will and pleasure
therefore is, that one serjeant, one corporal, and fifty private men,
be forthwith taken out of the three companies commanded by captains,
and ten private men from the three commanded by captain-lieutenants,
making one hundred and eighty men, who are to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
equally distributed into the four companies hereby to be raised;
and the three serjeants and three corporals, draughted as aforesaid,
to be placed to such of the four companies as you shall judge
proper; and the remainder of the non-commissioned officers and
private men, wanting to complete them to the above number, to be
raised in the Highlands with all possible speed; the men to be
natives of that country, and none other to be taken.</p>

<p>This regiment shall commence and take place according to the
establishment thereof. And of these our orders and commands,
you, and the said three captains, and the three captain-lieutenants
commanding at present the six Independent Highland Companies,
and all others concerned, are to take notice, and to yield obedience
thereunto accordingly.</p>

<p>Given at our Court at St. James’s, this 25th day of October,
1739, and in the 13th year of our reign.</p>

<p class="right padr4">By His Majesty’s Command,</p>

<p>The tallest men of the Regiment of that period were formed into a
Grenadier Company and wore the Grenadier bearskin. The rest of the
uniform as above and the substitution of the blue bonnet for the bearskin
was the uniform for the rest of the Regiment.</p></div>
</div>

<p>May, 1740, these ten companies were mustered in a field between
Taybridge and Aberfeldy and in the army list of that year
were known as “Earl of Crawford’s Regiment of Foot in the Highlands.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
There have been several changes of the official name of the
Regiment but the “Black Watch” was always the familiar one in
the country where it has drawn its recruits and since 1881 has been
the official name in the British Army List.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uniform of this period was a “scarlet jacket and waistcoat,
with buff facings and white lace, tartan plaid of twelve yards
plaited round the middle of the body, the upper part being fixed
on the left shoulder, ready to be thrown loose and wrapped over
both shoulders and firelock in rainy weather. At night, the plaid
served the purpose of a blanket, and was a sufficient covering for
the Highlanders. These were called belted plaids, from being kept
tight to the body by a belt, and were worn on guards, reviews, and
on all occasions when the men were in full dress. On this belt
hung the pistols and dirk when worn. In the barracks, and when
not on duty, the little kilt or philibeg was worn, a blue bonnet with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
a border of white, red, and green, arranged in small squares to
resemble, as is said, the fess cheque in the arms of the different
branches of the Stewart family, and a tuft of feathers, or sometimes,
from economy or necessity, a small piece of black bearskin.
The arms were a musket, a bayonet, and a large basket-hilted
broadsword. These were furnished by Government; such of the
men as chose to supply themselves with pistols and dirks were
allowed to carry them, and targets after the fashion of the country.
The sword-belt was of black leather, and the cartouch-box was
carried in front, supported by a narrow belt round the middle.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“While the companies acted independently, each commander
assumed the tartan of his own Clan. When embodied, no clan
having a superior claim to offer an uniform plaid to the whole, and
Lord Crawford, the colonel, being a Lowlander, a new pattern
was assumed, and which has ever since been known as the 42d, or
Black Watch tartan, being distinct from all others.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Lord John
Murray gave the Athole tartan for the philibeg. The difference
was only a stripe of scarlet, to distinguish it from that of the
belted plaid. The pipers wore a red tartan of very bright colours,
(of the pattern known by the name of the Stewart or Royal Tartan),
so that they could be more clearly seen at a distance. When
a band of music was added, plaids of the pipers’ pattern were given
to them.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Having given briefly the origin of the Regiment, we will pass
to the period which is the subject of our article.</p>

<p>May, 1756, war having been formally declared between France
and England, a body of troops, the Highlanders forming a part,
were embarked under the command of Lieut. General James Abercrombie
and landed at New York, June, 1756. These were soon
followed by more troops under the Earl of Loudon who was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Army of America.</p>

<p>The official name of the Regiment at this time was the 42d
Regiment of Foot, but they are often spoken of in dispatches
simply as the Highlanders, because they were the only Highland
Regiment then in this section, or as Lord John Murray’s Highlanders
from the custom of the times of calling a Regiment by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
name of its Honorary Colonel. The commander of the Black
Watch at this time was Lieut. Col. Francis Grant, son of the Laird
of Grant, who had served in the Regiment from the time he had
received his commission as Ensign, October 25, 1739. He was made
Lieutenant Colonel December 17, 1755 and was in command of the
Regiment all through the American campaign. The only other
officer who had served continuously from the formation of the
Regiment in 1739 was Gordon Graham of Drainie, who in 1756 was
senior captain.</p>

<p>The record of the Regiment from the landing in June, 1756,
until the battle of July, 1758, is exceedingly meagre. In fact
nothing of importance was done by the whole army. As one author
puts it “Loudon was so engrossed in schemes for improving the
condition of his men that he seemed to have no time for employing
them against the enemy.” The following extract from a letter
from the Earl of Loudon to William Pitt dated New York, March
10th, 1757, will illustrate the method of quartering troops of that
period.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the end of your letter you have acquainted me, that words
shall be inserted, in the mutiny act to take away every doubt about
the Right of Quartering extending to America.</p>

<p>When I writ on that subject, I was but just arrived, and the
troops were mostly encamped. Since that I have had disputes to
settle, all over this Continent, in settling the winter quarters for
the Troops from whence I find, that the manner of quartering in
England, as in time of peace, on Publick Houses only, will in no
shape answer the intent in this country, for there are few Publick
Houses and most of them sell nothing but spirits, where they possess
only one room in which they sell the liquor, where men cannot be
quartered.</p>

<p>Whilst the war lasts, necessity will justify exceeding that rule,
as Troops must be under cover, in the places where it is necessary
to post them, for the security of the country and carrying on the
service, but as soon as a peace comes, it will, by the English rule,
be impossible to quarter any number of Troops, in this country,
without a new regulation, and the only remedy that occurs to me at
present, is adopting the method of quartering in Scotland, where
for the same reason of there not being Publick Houses sufficient
for the reception of Troops they are by law quartered on private
houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>I must beg leave to give you one instance of the situation of
quarters here. When I arrived at Albany, I do not believe it was
possible to have quartered Fifty men on that town, on all the
Publick Houses in it, and taking a full survey of it, I found that
by quartering on the Private Houses, I can, without incommoding
them, in the parts of their houses, in which they live, quarter
Fourteen Hundred men, and for a short time, in case of necessity,
I could quarter Two thousand. I have mentioned this to show you
what the situation of all the Frontier Places, in this country that
are liable to attacks, must be, if quartering is likely to be kept to,
on Publick Houses only.</p>

<p>On the 10th instant arrived the Harriet Packet which brought
me the duplicates of your letters of the 9th and 11th of January,
and the next day came in here His Majesty’s ship the Hampshire
commanded by Captain Norbury, having under his convoy the
nine additional companies of the Highlanders,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-8" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'wha had a passage'">
who had a passage</ins>
of twelve weeks from Cork, and met with very bad weather; of
this convoy there were missing on his arrival in this Port, the
Arundal and Salisbury Transports. The last we have, since,
accounts of her getting into Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The Troops being sickly, I have cantooned them in villages
adjacent to this Port, for the sake of fresh provisions and vegetables.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the published histories of the time it is stated that the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“42d remained inactive in or near Albany during 1756 and that
throughout the winter and spring of the following year the men
were drilled and disciplined for bush fighting and markmanship,
a species of warfare for which they were well fitted, being for the
most part good shots and experts in the management of arms.”</p>
</div>

<p>From the following letters found in the Public Record Office
in London the quarters for the winter of 1756-7 were probably
at Schenectady. Extract from letter from Loudon to Pitt,
New York, 25th April, 1757,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Highlanders were set in motion
from Schenectady <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> they marched without tents and lay
in the woods upon the snow making great fires and I do not find
the troops have suffered <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> We have on that River (Mohawk)
at Schenectady and up to the German Flats, the Highland Regiment
upwards of a thousand men,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>
</div>

<p>The second letter reads as follows, and while it is chiefly of
interest in this connection because it is dated from Schenectady,
it also illustrates the custom of selling commissions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Schenectady, April 24, 1757.</p>
<p class="noindent">Francis Grant, Lt. Col. 42d Regiment.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>I am convinced from several things that have happened me
since I have been in the Regiment that my continuing to serve any
longer in it would be disagreeable to the whole corps of officers and
being likewise sensible of my own unfitness for a military life I
have resolved to quit the Army as soon as I can obtain leave to
resign my commission. But as I have nothing else in the world to
depend upon and finding myself at present at a distance from
my family and friends or anyone whom I can depend on for
advice, interest or assistance and having frequently experienced
your goodness and favor, I have made bold to apply to you that
you would be pleased to intercede with his Excellency the Earl of
Loudon, in my behalf that His Lordship in consideration of my
distressed situation and circumstances might be moved to give me
leave to resign in favor of some person that would be willing to
allow me wherewithal to support me till I can settle and apply to
some other way of life.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">In doing me this favor you’ll forever oblige, Sir,</span><br />
Your respectful and gratefully obed’t hum. serv’t,<br />
George Maclagan, Ens.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;If it is agreeable to your Lordship I am willing to pay
fifty pound Sterling for Mr. Peter Grant Voluntier.</p>

<p class="right">
Francis Grant, Lt. Col. 42d. Regt.”</p>
</div>

<p>With these two dispatches from the British War Office as a
clew I have tried to learn more about the winter quarters of the
Black Watch and have looked through the Colonial manuscript in
the New York State Library,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the Records of the City of Albany
and the published works of the period but so far without success.
I have been unable to find any Schenectady records of this period.
It seems that a valuable collection of Glen-Sanders papers from the
old Mansion across the Mohawk from Schenectady was recently
sold and I have been told that in these there were several references<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to officers of the Black Watch. As the Glens<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> were Scots it
would be quite likely that if this collection were not now scattered
to the four winds much information about the Highlanders could
be obtained. It is said that Schenectady was only a frontier village
in 1756 and not large enough to take care of a regiment and
it seems to be a fact from the reference given above that only a
part of the thousand men were stationed here as it states that the
Regiment was stretched along the Mohawk from Schenectady to
the German Flats, but that it was a station for troops is proven by
the list in the Public Record Office of the winter quarters for the
troops in America for 1758, which states that the Black Watch
was quartered in New York and Lt. General Murray’s at Schenectady.
There is in the Public Record Office no list of winter quarters
of the troops in America previous to 1758.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It appears, however, from the Town Records of Stamford,
Conn., that a committee representing that town made a claim on
the “General Court” of the Colony of Connecticut to reimburse
them for £369-13-4½ which the town had expended “in taking
care of the Highlanders from November 30, 1757, to March 30,
1758. The soldiers numbered 250 officers and men and they had
also belonging to them 17 women and 9 children.” They were
probably part of the Black Watch. The only other Highland regiments
of that time were Montgomery’s and Fraser’s, both raised in
1757 and their arrival at New York from Halifax is noted in the
“Post Boy” of April 11, 1757. This town record also further
illustrates the custom of that time as previously stated and as an
officer of the present Regiment aptly puts it, “they took not only
their mess plate but their wives also, on service with them, and
sometimes lost both.”</p>

</div>

<p>This 250 at Stamford would only be a quarter of the Regiment,
however, if Loudon had upwards of a thousand at or near
Schenectady the winter before and it is probable that the rest were
quartered at or near Schenectady as in 1756.</p>

<p>Another statement that I have tried to confirm is the account
by James Grant in his “Legends of the Black Watch” of the 50
chosen men under orders of MacGillivray of Glen Arrow, who went
to reinforce Col. Munro at Fort William Henry. It is also said
in a foot note of Wilson’s Orderly Book that Capt. Gordon Graham
was at Fort William Henry at the time of the surrender, and this
is repeated in N. Y. Colonial Mss. by O’Callaghan, page 728, Vol.
10, but I have not been able to find any other reference that would
substantiate these statements.</p>

<p>The only time the 42d emerges from the haze of mystery from
June, 1756, to the spring of 1758, is that they were a part of
Loudon’s expedition against Louisbourg in 1757, and this was more
a summer vacation than an act of war.</p>

<p>If the English could have attacked Louisbourg in the spring
or early summer, success would have been certain but Loudon
couldn’t seem to get started. As a messenger from the Governor
of Pennsylvania, who had waited in vain for a reply to a message,
said about him he was like “St. George on a tavern sign, always
on horse back and never riding on.” The expedition did not
start from New York until June 20th and entered Halifax harbor
the 30th. Even after this delay he was there before Admiral Holbourne,
who did not arrive from England with his fleet of 15 ships-of-the-line
and 3 frigates, with 5,000 troops until July 10th. Then
there was more delay, the 12,000 troops were landed and weeks
spent in drilling and planting vegetables for their refreshment.
Lord Charles Hay was put under arrest for saying that the “nation’s
money was spent in sham battles and raising cabbages.” The
troops were embarked again, but Aug. 4th a sloop came from Newfoundland
bringing news of the arrival of three French squadrons
at Louisbourg and as an attack after this reinforcement would be
hopeless, the costly enterprise was abandoned and Loudon and the
troops sailed back to New York where he arrived Aug. 31st. Delay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]<br /><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
was the ruin of the Louisbourg expedition and drew off British
forces from the frontier where they were most needed.</p>

<p>The troops were started immediately up the Hudson as soon
as they were landed at New York but Fort William Henry had
already been captured Aug. 9th and the French forces had fallen
back to Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>The spring of 1758 opened up with bright prospects. Lord
Loudon had been recalled and General Abercrombie, with the able
assistance of Lord Howe, was in command. Admiral Boscowen
was appointed to command the fleet and Major-General Amherst
and Brigadier-Generals Wolfe, Townsend and Murray were added
to the military staff. Three expeditions were proposed for this
year, Louisbourg, Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and Fort DuQuesne.
The army in America had been largely reinforced during
the winter and spring. Of these reinforcements the 42d was strengthened
by three additional companies and recruits bringing the Regiment
up to about 1,300 men.</p>

<p>As we have considerable information about these three companies
through the Atholl Records, it will be interesting to turn
back and follow them from the start to the beginning of the Ticonderoga
campaign. The first item and one of interest because it
shows the method of raising companies in those days, is a letter
from the Duke of Argyll to the Duke of Atholl, dated London,
July 9, 1757.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Lord:&mdash;This is to acquaint your Grace that there is to be
3 additional Companies raised for Lord John Murray’s Regiment.
I believe the nomination of the officers will be left to me and consequently
to Your Grace; there will be 3 captains, 6 lieutenants and
3 ensigns and 100 men each company. The raising the men will
be the merit of those who shall desire to be officers and if any can
be found who have served in Holland, so much the better. Your
Grace will have your thought on this but don’t promise anybody
till you let me hear from you. I shall speak to Lord John but I
will bid him consult you and will plainly tell him that the commissions
must all be given gratis. The other two Highland Regiments
will likewise have the same addition made to them.</p>

<p>I am with the greatest truth and respect, My Lord, Yr Gr’s
most faithful and obt. h’ble Servant, Argyll.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>By the Duke of Atholl’s recommendation the three companies
were given to James Stewart of Urrard; James Murray, nephew
of the Duke of Atholl and son of Lord George Murray; and
Thomas Stirling of Ardoch. Three of the new subalterns were from
the Atholl estate, namely Lieut. Alexander Menzies and Ensigns
Duncan Stewart, son of Derculich, and George Rattray, son of
Dalralzion. The three companies were mustered in October and
marched from Perth to Glasgow, where they remained until November
15, when they marched to Greenock and embarked December
1st in transports for Cork en route to America.</p>

<p>April 22, 1758, Capt. James Murray wrote from New York to
Mr. Murray of Strowan announcing his safe arrival after a voyage
of eleven weeks from Cork. The joys of a voyage in those times
when it could take ten days to sail from Scotland to Ireland, is
illustrated by a letter from Capt. Murray, dated Youghall, 11
Dec., 1757.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear Brother:&mdash;This is to let you know that I am just now
in good health and safely arrived here with my company. My
transport, together with the other five, set sail on the 1st cur’t in
the evening along with the Convoy; we had a fair wind and good
weather until Sunday, early in the morning (when we were past
Waterfort in our way to Corck) about eight, there came on one
of the most prodigeous storms that the sailors said they had never
seen the like before. About two in the afternoon we lost sight of
the Convoy and all the transports and have not yet any sure
accounts whether they have got all safe into harbours or not. But
since I came here I hear that there was five or six ships lost on the
Coast that day. The storm abated somewhat Monday morning
but it continued bad weather until Friday evening, during which
time we were often in risk of our lives especially twice, once being
within two yards of a great rock and the other time when we were
on two fathom water going on a sandbank.</p>

<p>During all that time we were near several harbours, such as
Doublin, Waterfort, Corck and others but all without success.
Saturday and this day we had good weather by which means we
got into harbour.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">Your most aff’te brother,</span><br />
James Murray.</p>
</div>

<p>From November until April seems a long voyage from Scotland
to America even in those days of primitive navigation, but another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of the three additional companies was blown into Antigua and did
not arrive at New York until June.</p>

<p>With the activities of the preparations for the Ticonderoga
campaign a number of dispatches were sent to the Home Government
and it is possible to follow more closely the fortunes of the
Black Watch.</p>

<p>The addition of these three companies raised the Regiment to
1,300 men, and we find among the official documents a petition from
Capt. Gordon Graham, endorsed by Lt. Col. Grant and General
Abercrombie, asking to be made Major in addition to Major Duncan
Campbell, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

the King, and to know His Royal Pleasure therein.</p>
</div>

<p>Extract from a letter signed James Abercromby to the Right
Hon. Lord Viscount Barrington, dated New York, Apr. 28, 1758.</p>

<p>As will be seen later Capt. Graham became Major before hearing
from the King.</p>

<div id="letter_1"></div>
<p>The next dispatch which is of interest and which makes changes
in the list of Commissioned Officers is as follows: Extract from
letter signed by James Abercromby to the Right Honorable the
Lord Viscount Barrington, dated Albany, May 27, 1758.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the list of the Commissions which I had the honour to
transmit to your Lordship, by my last letter, you will have
observed two vacancies in the 42nd Regiment, occasioned by the
removal of Sir James Cockburn into the 48th which could not be
filled up at the time my letter went away, as the gentlemen, whom
it was proposed should purchase those vacancies were then at
Albany,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and their answer not arrived; since that the Lieutenancy
has been made out in the name of Mr. Patrick Balnevas, and bears
date the 1st of April; and Mr. Elbert Hering succeeds to the
Ensigncy, dated the 3rd of the same month.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then we have the dispatch just before the battle from Abercrombie
to Pitt, dated Camp at Lake George, June 29, 1758, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Arrived Fort Edward on the 9th, where Lord Howe was
encamped with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th Regiments and 4 companies
of Rangers. Remainder of Regulars were at posts below on Hudson
River and were working up the stores, etc. On the 17th Lord
Howe marched to the Brook, half way between Fort Edward and
the Lake with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th. This Half-way Brook
was judged a proper post for the first Deposit in a Portage of 15
miles.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> After the carriages had made several trips Lord Howe
advanced to the Lake with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Attached to this letter is a report of troops at Lake George,
June 29, 1758, and the roll of the 42nd was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“10 companies, 1 Lt. Colonel, 1 Major, 8 Captains, 18 Lieutenants,
7 Ensigns, 1 Chaplain, 1 Adjutant, 1 QuarterMaster, 1
Surgeon, 2 Mates, 40 Sergeants, 18 Drummers; Rank and File&mdash;981
fit for duty, 11 sick present, 6 in general hospital, 2 on command,
1,000 total. 1 drummer and 40 rank and file wanting to complete.”</p>
</div>

<p>We find the solution of why there were only 1,000 of the
Black Watch with the Ticonderoga expedition when its strength
was known to be 1,300 at that time, in another extract of the
Report of June 29th from Abercrombie to Pitt: “I have left two
additional Companies of Lord John Murray’s to garrison Fort
Edward. The other additional company of the 42nd which was
blown into Antego (Antigua), I hear is arrived at New York,
which I have ordered up to Albany.”</p>

<p>This is confirmed in more detail in a letter from Sir Robert
Menzies to Mr. Murray of Strowan, dated Rannock, 6th Sept.,
1758, in which is an extract from a letter received by Menzies from
“Jamie Stewart.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>“That, after the additional Companies arrived in Fort Edward,
the best men were picked out to compleat the Regiment in
place of the sick and old men that were put in their place. That,
as Capt. Reid was left behind sick at Albany, Capt. Murray was
appointed to his company and Reid to the additionals, as Capt.
Abercrombie was to Capt. Murray’s Company. That the additional
companies, with Captains Sterling, Reid, and Abercrombie, etc.,
were left at Fort Edward, where they had nothing to do but to
garrison the Fort and divert themselves.”</p>

<p>Everything is now in readiness for the attack <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'on Ticonderogt'">
on Ticonderoga</ins> and an army of six thousand three hundred seventy-seven regulars
and nine thousand thirty-four provincials (Abercrombie to Pitt
July 12, 1758) embarked at Lake George early on the morning of
July 5th. There were nine hundred batteaux, a hundred and thirty-five
whale boats and a large number of heavy flatboats carrying
the artillery and from front to rear the line was six miles long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>Parkman in his “Montcalm and Wolfe” paints the scene as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The spectacle was superb; the brightness of the summer
day; the romantic beauty of the scenery; the sheen and
sparkle of those crystal waters; the countless islets, tufted with
pine, birch, and fir; the bordering mountains, with their green
summits and sunny crags; the flash of oars and glitter of weapons;
the banners, the varied uniforms, and the notes of bugle, trumpet,
bag-pipe, and drum, answered and prolonged by a hundred woodland
echoes. ‘I never beheld so delightful a prospect,’ wrote a
wounded officer at Albany a fortnight after.</p>

<p>“Rogers with the Rangers, and Gage with the light infantry,
led the way in whaleboats, followed by Bradstreet with his corps
of boatman, armed and drilled as soldiers. Then came the main
body. The central column of regulars was commanded by Lord
Howe, his own regiment, the fifty-fifth, in the van, followed by the
Royal Americans, the twenty-seventh, forty-fourth, forty-sixth,
and eightieth infantry, and the Highlanders of the forty-second,
with their major, Duncan Campbell of Inverawe, silent and
gloomy amid the general cheer, for his soul was dark with foreshadowings
of death. With this central column came what are
described as two floating castles, which were no doubt batteries to
cover the landing of the troops. On the right hand and the left
were the provincials, uniformed in blue, regiment after regiment,
from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and
Rhode Island. Behind them all came the batteaux, loaded with
stores and baggage, and the heavy flatboats that carried the artillery,
while a rear-guard of provincials and regulars closed the long
procession.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be unnecessary to go into the details of this disastrous
campaign as it is not only well known to most of you but three
papers bearing on the subject will be read at this meeting.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Briefly
the army landed at the foot of Lake George the morning of the
6th and the afternoon of the same day Lord Howe at the head of
a Ticonderoga party was killed at the outlet of Trout Brook. This
is the beginning of the end as Lord Howe was the real head of the
army. Abercrombie took until the eighth to make up his mind
what to do and this interim gave the French time to build the
fatal breastworks across the ridge about one-half mile west of the
Fort and enabled Lévis to arrive with reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>As the breastworks play a most important part in the Battle
it will perhaps be well to again quote from Parkman who gives a
most comprehensive description.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The trees that covered the
ground were hewn down by thousands, the tops lopped off, and
the trunks piled one upon another to form a massive breastwork.
The line followed the top of the ridge, along which it zigzagged in
such a manner that the whole front could be swept by flank-fires
of musketry and grape. It was so high that nothing could be
seen over it but the crowns of the soldiers’ hats. The upper tier
was formed of single logs, in which notches were cut to serve as
loopholes; and in some places sods and bags of sand were piled
along the top, with narrow spaces to fire through. From the central
part of the line the ground sloped away like a natural glacis;
while at the sides, and especially on the left, it was undulating
and broken. Over this whole space, to the distance of a musket-shot
from the works, the forest was cut down, and the trees left
lying where they fell among the stumps, with tops turned outwards,
forming one vast abattis, which, as a Massachusetts officer
says, looked like a forest laid flat by a hurricane. But the most
formidable obstruction was immediately along the front of the
breastworks, where the ground was covered with heavy boughs,
overlapping and interlaced, with sharpened points bristling into
the face of the assailant like the quills of a porcupine. As these
works were all of wood, no vestige of them remains. The earth-works
now shown to tourists as the lines of Montcalm were begun
four days after the battle to replace the log breastwork; and though
on the same ground are not on the same plan.”</p>
</div>

<p>Behind these breastworks the battalions of LaSarre and Languedoc
were posted on the left under Bourlamaque, the first battalion
of Berry with that of Royal Roussillon in the center under
Montcalm and those of LaReine, Béarn and Guienne on the right
under Lévis. A detachment of volunteers occupied the low grounds
between the breastworks and the outlet of Lake George and on
the side toward Lake Champlain were stationed 450 regulars and
Canadians, about 3,600 in all.</p>

<p>It is always easy to criticise an event after it has occurred,
but the result certainly shows that Abercrombie could not have
planned his campaign more to the advantage of the French. He
first gave them time to build those formidable breastworks and then
instead of choosing any one of half a dozen plans which would have
brought victory, he decided to throw his army unsupported by
artillery, which was still at Lake George, at the strongest part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the French position, he himself staying in safety at the saw mill
(about which we heard this afternoon in the able paper read by
Mr. Delano at the unveiling of the tablet) a mile and a half in
the rear of his army.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The sad result is too well known to dwell on and we pass at
once to the part played by the Black Watch. They, with the 55th
were to have formed the reserve but impatient at being left in the
rear the Highlanders could not be restrained and were soon in the
front endeavoring to cut their way through the fallen trees with
their broadswords. Captain John Campbell, who was one of the
two soldiers presented to George II in 1743, with a few men, were
the only ones to force their way over the breastworks and they
were instantly dispatched with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Lieut. William Grant of the Regiment writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The attack began a little past one in the afternoon and about
two the fire became general on both sides. It was exceedingly heavy
and without intercession insomuch as the oldest soldier never saw
so furious and incessant a fire. The fire at Fontenoy was nothing
to it. I saw both.”</p>
</div>

<p>An officer of the 55th regiment, of which Lord Howe had been
the commander, wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With a mixture of esteem, grief and envy, I am penetrated
by the great loss and immortal glory acquired by the Highlanders
engaged in the late bloody affair. Impatient for the fray, they
rushed forward to the entrenchments which many of them actually
mounted, their intrepidity was rather animated than dampened by
witnessing their comrades fall on every side. They seemed more
anxious to avenge the fate of their deceased friends than to avoid
a like death. In their co-operation we trust soon to give a good
account of the enemy and of ourselves. There is much harmony
and friendship between the two regiments.”</p>
</div>

<p>Even the French were impressed with the valor of the Black
Watch as Garneau writes in L’Histoire du Canada.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Highlanders above all, under Lord John Murray, covered
themselves with glory. They formed the head of the troops confronting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the Canadians, their light and picturesque costume distinguishing
them from all other soldiers amid the flame and smoke.
This corps lost half of its men and 25 of its officers were killed or
severely wounded.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lossing writes,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The whole army seemed envious to excell
but the Scotch Highland Regiment of Lord John Murray was foremost
in the conflict and suffered the severest loss.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The following letters from Captain Allan Campbell are of
interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Camp at Lake George, 11th July, 1758.</p>

<p>Dr. Broyr.,&mdash;The 8th of this month we had a hot brush at the
lines of Ticonderoga where we lost a considerable number of men
and officers. The officers of your acquentance wounded are Major
Campbell and his son. Both in their arms, and I hope will do well.
Captain Stratchur slightly in the breast, Ltt. Archd. Campbell
Sheriff Badly in the Breast, Lt. John Campbell Glendaruel slightly
in the arm, Capt. Ltt. John Campbell Duneaves killed, Ltt. Hugh
Macpherson ditto, Capt. Graham, Duchra, and Broyr. Both
wounded slightly and several other offrs. of the Regt, but not of
your acquentance are killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Our Regt, acquired great glory by their good behaviour of both
men and officers, tho’ we were unsuccessfull. I have the pleasure
to aquent you that both my nephew George and I eskeaped without
a scratch, tho’ both in the heat of the action. George is a pritty
Lad: he’s now a Ltt. in Coll. Gages Regt, of Lt. Infantry. Your
son the Major was well about 2 months ago at Philadelphia. We
are now at the end of Lake George Encampt. I have told you now
all the news that can occurr to me or that I have time to write you,
and I thought it my duty to acquent you and my other Broyrs. of
my being well after a smart action. I have no time to write you
more being excessively hurried having no Body to assist me in the
affairs of my Company having my three Ltts. killed or wounded viz.
Ltt. Balie killed and Ltts. Archd. Campbell and William Grant
wounded. I’ll write you very fully in my nixt. My best wishes to
my sister, to your family and all our friends, and I am Dr. Bryr,
your most affec. and Lov. Broyr, while</p>

<p class="right">Allan Campbell.</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">New York, 6th January 1759.</p>

<p>Dr. Brother,&mdash;I writt you the 11th July in a great hurry after
our retreat from Ticonderoga to let you know of mine and George’s
welfair, after that unlucky afair, where severall of our friends and
a great many worthy Fellows suffer’d. Our Regt, lost more than
any other Corps at the attack of the Lines. We have had killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and wounded since the beginning of the Campaign 520 (officers
included) of which about 300 were left dead on the field or have
dyed of their wounds, and of 37 officers that were present with the
Regt. that day 11 only came off unhurt, of which number I was
lucky enough to be one.</p>

<p>You would certainly hear before now of poor Major Campbell
Inveraw’s death, he liv’d about a fortnight after he receiv’d
his wound, the Doctors thought it necessary that his arm should be
cut off, and he dyed soon after the operation at Fort Edward, all
the rest of our wounded officers are quite recover’d except his son,
Sandy, Jock Campbell Glendaruel, and Archie Shirreff, but they
are out of all danger, only their cure will be tedious.</p>

<p>Poor George had a narrow escape the day we landed at the
French end of the Lake, having had a scratch along the face with
a musquet Ball. He was in a smart little action that happen’d in
the woods a mounth afterwards between a detachment of 500 of
our army under the command of Major Rogers and much the same
number of Indians French and Canadians, where the latter were
repulsed with the loss of 100 men, and I assure you his behaviour
at that affair was much aplauded by his Broyr. officers on their
return to the Army.</p>

<p>He’s now second oldest Lieut, in General Gage’s Regt. of light
arm’d infantry, for which he’s obliged to the late Major Campbell,
Inveraw; and as they talk at present of agmenting that corps, he’ll
have a good chance of getting Higher up, and in any event he’s
better off by being so High in that Regt. as they are now an
Establish’d Corps, than if he had staid in ours, where he could be
but a young Lieut. His Coll, has a great regard for him, and very
Deservedly for he’s a lad of good morals, a good spirit, and very
fit for his Business. He has acted as Adjutant to that Regt. since
July last, by which he has nothing yet but Troble, there being no
Adjutant allow’d, and that his Collonel means it for him; if he’s
lucky enough to get that, I think he’s very well provided for for
the time he has served.</p>

<p>I have advanc’d him Twenty Guineas for which he gave me a
Bill on you. I hope you’ll not Disaprove of my conduct for doing
it, nor blame him for running so much short, when I explain to you
the cause of it; its trew he came over very well Riged out, but his
changing Corps put him under a necessity of Buying new Regimentals,
as these Differ in Colours from the rest of the Army, being
Brown, besides his expense must be greater upon his first comming
in among Strangers, and he had the misfortune of being sent a
recruiting last winter, which really is a misfortune to an officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in this Country unless he is very carfull and happens to be successful,
and I belive George lost by it. This I ashure you is truth,
and when you consider it was owing to these accidents, that he
could not possibly guard against, I am hopfull you’l easily forgive
him. I was likewise oblig’d to advance our Unkle Corries’ son,
Colin, Twenty two Pounds eighteen shillings and tenpence or he
must have gone naked, having lost all his things at Fort William
Henry. I have sent both Bills to Brother Robert. George and
Colin are sent this winter a Recruiting to Pensilvania.</p>

<p>I had a letter dated the 30 Novr. from my nephew, the Major,
from where Fort du Quesne stood, he was then very well. I expect
dayly to hear from him, he’s had as troublesome and Fatigueing
Campaign of it, as ever any Body had, our Army has been above
a Month in Winter Quarters befor thers got to Fort du Quesne,
which the French burnt upon ther near aproach, and an immense
long march they have to get back to Philadelphia, wher ther Regt,
is to be Quarter’s this winter, and where I intend to go and see
him, when I hear of ther arrival, its about 100 miles from this
place that our Regt, is now quartere’d in.</p>

<p>We long much for a Pacquet here having no news from Europe
for some months, I take the opportunity of writing you now by the
Kennington Man of War that carries home General Abercrombie.
<span class="nowrap">* * *</span></p>

<p>There is no News here at Present. All our Friends in this
Country are Well. Remember my best wishes to my Sister, and the
rest of your Family whom may God Almighty bless and I ever am,

<p>I also give in full the letter written by Capt. James Murray
to his brother, Mr. Murray of Strowan, dated Albany, July 19,
1758, as his description of the country and the events during and
after the battle lend color to the picture.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Dear Brother:&mdash;The last letter I wrote you was dated
from Fort Edward camp about 18th June. We proceeded on to
Lake George where Fort William Henry formerly stood which was
taken and destroyed by the French last year, where we remained
until the 5th curt. and then the whole army embarked on the lake
in batteaux that hold 23 men with a month’s provisions all the
artillery stores was likewise embarked, and everything else belonging
to an army. We were divided into brigades. There was in all
about 5,000 regulars and 12,000 provincials. We had also light
infantry and rangers who had whale-boats which are the lightest
and best going boats that can be made. We put off about 8 and got
fairly into the lake which I took to be about 20 miles long and not
above two miles at the broadest part of it. There are several small
islands which are quite covered with wood and all around the lake
is very hilly and quite covered with woods, as the most part of the
country is, at least what I have seen on’t.</p>

<p>This lake abounds in fine trout the meat of which is red,
pearch, suckers and several other sorts of fish. There is also plenty
of beavers. On the side of the lake there is plenty of deer but I
have not seen any since I came to the country. Sometimes when
I have been out on command I have killed rattle snakes about four
feet long and as thick as the small of one’s leg, with 18 rattles,
which altogether might be about four inches long. They say some
have twenty or more. They have both teeth and a sting. The
rattles being at the tail makes them that they can stand up on end
and spring a short way at one. When touched they make a great
noise with their rattles. Their bite is not so bad as called for it
can be easily cured with oil or salt. They smell exactly like a
goat, rather ranker if possible before they are seized but afterwards
have almost no smell at all. They make the richest and best soup
that can be which I eat of and like much. The meat is but insipid.</p>

<p>The 6th we disembarked at the lower end of the lake. In the
morning out light infantry and rangers had some skirmishing with
the French pickets. Lord Howe was killed at the second shot and
he is very much regretted. There was taken that day about 150
prisoners, five of whom were officers. They had a great many killed
so that very few of their pickets escaped which consisted in all
of about 350.</p>

<p>The next day being the 7th, we were making preparations to
invest a fort called Theenderora which is five miles from Lake
George and is situate on a neck of land that runs into Lake Champlain.
As to the dimensions of that lake I can’t say, and marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
within a mile and half of it that evening. The next morning the
light infantry made the French sentries and small posts retire to
their entrenchments for the French had an encampment about half
a cannon shot before their fort, and were entrenched after the
following manner: They had large cut trees one laid above another
a man’s height and in the outside there was brush and logs for
about 15 paces from it which made it impossible to force their
breastworks without cannon which we had not taken up that length
as then. They were also under cover of the fort or if we could beat
them out of their trenches, they could have retired pretty safely.</p>

<p>Between one and two we marched up and attacked the trenches
and got within twenty paces of them and had as hot a fire for about
three hours as possibly could be, we all the time seeing but their
hats and the end of their muskets. About half an hour before we
were obliged to retire I received a shot through my thigh after
which I stayed a few minutes but finding if I stayed any longer my
thigh would turn stiff and losing a great deal of blood I with help
got into the road and that evening with Capt. Gordon Graham, our
paymaster, got into a whaleboat and against the next morning got
to the upper end of Lake George and was transported down here.
I am confined to my bed but the surgeons say my wound looks as
well as can be expected, nor is there any sort of danger in it as it
has only grazed the bone, so I shall be well soon again. I am in
perfect good health, have a good appetite and sleep tolerably well.</p>

<p>Our regiment has suffered much. There was the captain,
lieutenant and six subalterns killed on the spot and since the major
and the lieutenant have died of their wounds. The colonel, four
captains, and twelve subalterns are wounded. 180 men killed and
280 wounded. None of the other regiments’ losses were near so
great. Capt. Stewart was not touched, Capt. Sterling nor Farquharson
were not there so are well, but Lieut. Farquharson’s younger
brother was killed. Lieut. David Mills, my lieutenant, is not ill
wounded and is pretty well, so if you would inform his father-in-law,
Mr. Hamilton, of Hutcheson, who stays near Glasgow, you
would oblige me. Neil Stewart at Perth knows him.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Lord John 15th May letting me know
you are all well which gave me a great deal of pleasure but it would
much more so to hear from some of you for it is very long since I
had that satisfaction, the last being at Ireland, for Lord John wrote
me no particulars.</p>

<p>Offer my humble duty to my dear mother and elsewhere due
and best love to dear Lady Charlotte, Lady Sinclair, George, Charlotte
and Invercauld, and my best blessing attend all the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
ones. My kind compliments to Shusy Moray and tell her I had her
hair about my neck when I received my wound which might have
probably gone to my heart if it had not been wounded already.</p>

<p>I am ever your most effectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right">James Murray.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus had the army which landed so proudly two days before
been disastrously repulsed, with a loss in killed and wounded and
missing of nineteen hundred and forty-four officers and men. In
his report of July 12, 1758, Abercrombie gives the casualty of the
42nd as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Killed&mdash;Capt. Lt. John Campbell; Lts. George Farquharson,
Hugh McPherson, William Bailey, John Sutherland; Ensigns Peter
Stewart and George Rattray.</p>

<p>Wounded&mdash;Major Duncan Campbell; Captains Gordon Graham,
Thomas Graeme, John Campbell, James Stewart, James Murray;
Lieutenants William Grant, Robert Gray, John Campbell,
James Grant, John Graham, Alexander Campbell, Alexander McIntosh,
Archibald Campbell, David Mill,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Patrick Balnevis; Ensigns
John Smith and Peter Grant.</p>

<p>Summary&mdash;1 major wounded, captains 1 killed, 4 wounded;
lieutenants 4 killed, 11 wounded; ensigns 2 killed, 2 wounded;
adjutants 1 wounded; quarter master 1 wounded; sergeants 6 killed,
13 wounded, rank and file 190 killed, 265 wounded.”</p>
</div>

<p>Stewart of Garth writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of these the 42nd regiment had 8 officers, 9 serjeants, and
297 men killed, and 17 officers, 10 serjeants, and 306 soldiers
wounded. The officers were, Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe,
Captain John Campbell, Lieutenants George Farquharson, Hugh
McPherson, William Baillie, and John Sutherland; Ensigns Patrick
Stewart of Bonskied and George Rattray killed; Captains
Gordon Graham, Thomas Graham of Duchray, John Campbell of
Strachur, James Stewart of Urrad, James Murray (afterward General);
Lieutenants James Grant, Robert Gray, John Campbell,
William Grant, John Graham, brother of Duchray, Alexander
Campbell, Alexander Mackintosh, Archibald Campbell, David
Miller, Patrick Balneaves; and Ensigns John Smith and Peter
Grant, wounded.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Capt. James Murray writes from Albany 17th August, 1758:<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As I observed in my last, our regiment has suffered greatly. The
Major has since died of his wounds, Sandy Farquharson has got
his lieutenancy by seniority which one would not have thought that
the youngest ensign of the additionals would have been so soon a
lieutenant. I am recovering pretty well and can walk about although
I am much pained in my knee but hope will be able to
soon joint the regiment.”</p>
</div>

<p>Capt. James Stewart writes 14th July from Lake George:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That all the Captains were wounded, less or more, excepting
Captains McNeil and Allan Campbell, that Major Campbell got his
right arm wounded, but not dangerous and his son, Lieutenant
Alexander Campbell had his arm broke betwixt the elbow and
shoulder, but he was in a good way.”</p>
</div>

<p>Parkman states that Lt. Alexander Campbell was severely
wounded but reached Scotland alive and died in Glasgow.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Abercrombie reports to Pitt from Lake George, Aug. 19, 1758;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Major Duncan Campbell of the 42nd who was wounded in the
arm at the battle on the 8th was obliged to have it cut off and died
soon thereafter.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It would seem therefore that the wounds of Major Campbell
and his son were not necessarily fatal and that modern surgery
would have cured them. The following however, taken from Garneau’s
L’Histoire du Canada might explain the unexpected mortality.
“Scarcely any of the wounded Highlanders ever recovered
and even those sent home as invalids; their sores cankered, owing
to the broken glass, ragged bits of metal, etc., used by the Canadians
instead of shot.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Or this extract from letter of Brig. General James Wolfe to
Lord George Sackville:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

(Jane McCrea lot in Union Cemetery, between Fort Edward and Hudson Falls.)</div>
</div>

<p>Abercrombie states in his report of July 12, 1758,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sent the
wounded officers and the men that could be moved to Fort Edward
and Albany.”</p>
</div>

<p>Major Campbell was sent to Fort Edward and upon his death
nine days after the battle he was buried in the family lot of the
Gilchrists, in the old cemetery at Fort Edward. The body was
moved to the Gilchrist lot in the new Union cemetery between
Sandy Hill and Fort Edward in 1871, and in 1920 was moved
again to the Jane McCrea lot in the same cemetery. The original
stone may still be seen and bears the inscription: “Here Lyes the
body of Duncan Campbell of Inversaw, Esqr Major to The old
Highland Regt. Aged 55 Years. Who died The 17th July, 1758,
of wounds he received in the attack of the retrenchments of Ticonderoga
or Carillon, 8th July, 1758.”</p>

<p>Stewart of Garth says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The old Highland Regiment having
suffered so severely <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> they were not employed again that
year.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the N. Y. Colonial Records, however, we find that some
regulars of the 42nd and 6th Regts. amounting to 155 men (probably
one company of each) were with Bradstreet in his exposition
against Fort Frontenac.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In Abercrombie’s report of Aug. 19, 1758, he states that part
of the additional companies of the 42nd were sent to reinforce
Brig. General Provost at Fort Edward and that one company
of the 42nd and some of the recovering men were stationed at
Albany. From this it might be inferred that the only part of the
Black Watch fit for duty were the three additional companies which
had not been in the battle of July 8th and it is possible that the
one company of the 42nd that had been blown out of its course to
Antigua and had not arrived at New York until June did not get
further north than Albany. The winter quarters of the 42nd for
1758 were at New York. (Abercrombie to Pitt, No. 25, 1758.)<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The official title is now changed to the “42nd or Royal Regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of foot,” and the regiment is commonly called the Royal
Highlanders. It has erroneously been stated that the Black Watch
was granted this honor of being a “Royal” regiment because of its
gallantry at Ticonderoga, but it is all the more to its credit that it
had earned this distinction before the battle at Ticonderoga. The
title was granted by special warrant dated July 22, 1758, while the
news of the defeat did not reach London until the arrival of
Abercrombie’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" id="tn-28" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'aid de camp'">
aide de camp</ins></span> with dispatches Aug. 20, 1758.</p>

<p>A copy of the warrant is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George R</p>

<p>We being desirous to distinguish Our Forty Second Regiment
of Foot with some mark of Our Royal favor, Our Will and Pleasure
therefore is, and we do hereby direct, that from henceforth
Our said regiment be called, and distinguished by the title and
name of Our Forty-Second, or Royal Highland Regiment of Foot,
in all commissions, orders, and writings, that shall hereafter be
made out, or issued for and concerning the said regiment. Given
at Our Court at Kensington this 22nd day of July 1758, in the
thirty second year of Our reign. By His Majesty’s command.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; BARRINGTON.</p>
</div>

<p>The vacancies occasioned in the 42nd were filled up in regular
succession and the seven companies which had been ordered at the
same time as the change of title were immediately recruited. These
were completed in three months and embodied at Perth, October
1758, each company being 120 men strong, all with few exceptions
Highlanders and hardy and temperate in their habits. (Lord John
Murray’s orders were preemptory that none but Highlanders be
taken, but a few O’Donnels, O’Lachlans and O’Briens passed muster
as MacDonnels, MacLachlans and MacBriars.)</p>

<p>These seven companies with the three additional companies
raised in 1757 were formed into a Second Battalion. The officers
appointed to the seven new companies were Robert Anstruther,
who was senior captain and served as Major, Francis MacLean,
Alexander Sinclair, John Stewart of Stenton, William Murray of
Lintrose, Archibald Campbell, Alexander Reid, and Robert Arbuthnot,
to be captains; Alexander MacLean, George Grant, George
Sinclair, Gordon Clunes, Adam Stewart, John Robertson, son of
Lude, John Grant, James Fraser, George Leslie, John Campbell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Alexander Stewart, Duncan Richardson and Robert Robertson, to
be lieutenants and Patrick Sinclair, John Macintosh, James MacDuff,
Thomas Fletcher, Alexander Donaldson, William MacLean,
and William Brown, to be ensigns.</p>

<p>The seven new companies embarked for the West Indies where
they joined with <ins class="corr" id="tn-29" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Old Bluffs'">
the Old Buffs</ins>, Kings, 6th, 63rd, 64th, 800 marines
and a detachment of artillery amounting in all to 5,560 men under
the command of Major Generals Hopson and Barrington and
of Brigadier Generals Haldane, Armiger, Trapaud and Clavering,
in an exposition against Martinique and Gaudaloupe. This resulted
in the capture of Gaudaloupe but was not altogether a success
and a great many men were lost by fever and sickness. Of the
Royal Highlanders Ensign MacLean was killed, Lieutenants MacLean,
Leslie, Sinclair and Robertson were wounded, and Major
Anstruther and Captain Arbuthnot died of the fever. One hundred
and six privates were killed, wounded or died of disease.</p>

<p>This was a severe initiation for the new recruits who had been
herding sheep on their native hills nine months before, but as has
always been the case with the Black Watch they acquitted themselves
with distinction. The seven companies were then embarked
for New York to join the First Battalion where they arrived in
July. They just missed being at the capture of Ticonderoga. Major
Gordon Graham was ordered at the end of July by General Amherst
then at Crown Point to take command of the seven companies
and to march them up to Oswego. In August they were ordered to
join the First Battalion, Capt. Stewart with 150 men being left at
Oswego and the First and Second Battalions, now united, served
together for the rest of the campaign.</p>

<p>We will now return to the Veterans of the previous year.
After wintering in New York (or on Long Island, as another
authority states) the old Black Watch now the first Battalion of
the Royal Highlanders, recruited again to its full strength and the
three additional companies now a part of the Second Battalion,
joined Amherst at Fort Edward in June, 1759.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Col. Grant of the
42nd with the Royal Highlanders and light infantry of the army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
moved forward to Lake George the 20th and the main part of the
army followed on the 21st. For five years now Lake George had
been the annual mustering place of armies.</p>

<p>The campaign this season comprehended three very important
enterprises&mdash;Wolfe was to attack Quebec from Lower Canada,
Prideaux was to proceed against Niagara, and Amherst, now Commander
in Chief and successor of General Abercrombie, was to
drive the French from Lake Champlain and if possible join Wolfe
on the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The army under Amherst consisted of the Royals, 17th, 27th,
Royal Highlanders, two battalions of the 55th, Montgomery’s
Highlanders, nine battalions of Provincials, and a battalion of
light infantry and a body of Rangers and Indians with a detachment
of artillery. When joined by the 2d battalion of the Royal
Americans from the West Indies, this army amounted to 14,500
men.</p>

<p>Major Alexander Campbell of the 77th writes from Fort
Edward, June 19th, 1759:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our General is beloved by his soldiers, Honoured and Esteem’d
by his officers, Carful of mens lives and healths, in short he is the
man I would choose to serve under of any I know in the service.
Our Regiment are healthy and in High spirits as are the whole
army, and I hope we soon will stricke a stroke that will bring
credite and Glory to our General and Army and Satisfaction to
our Country and friends.”</p>
</div>

<p>Amherst never remained long in one place without building a
fort. Fortified places were built at intervals of three or four
miles along the road to Fort Edward and especially at the station
called Halfway Brook, while for the whole distance a broad belt
of wood on both sides was cut down and burned to deprive a
skulking enemy of cover. At Lake George he started a fort, now
called Fort George, the ruins of which are in the Lake George
Battle Ground Park of which this Association is custodian.</p>

<p>July 21st, 1759, Lake George again witnessed a military
pageant as the army embarked for its second attack on Fort Ticonderoga.
At daylight they landed, beat back a French detachment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and marched by the portage road to the sawmill. There was little
resistance and the army marched to the former line of entrenchments
which had proved so fatal to Abercrombie. These had been
reconstructed partly of earth and partly of logs, and as the French
made no attempt at their defence the English encamped along their
front and found them excellent shelter from the cannon of the fort.
It is the general impression that the French retreated with only
faint resistance and that there was hardly a shot fired at the
second attempt to capture Fort Carrillon but the following letter
from Capt. Murray would correct this impression:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“Camp at the Lines of Burning Theanderoga, 27 July, 1758.</p>

<p>My Dear Brother:&mdash;I write you these few lines to acquaint you
that I am in perfect good health and that the army landed at this
end of the lake the 22nd, invested the Fort the 23rd and was very
buisy carying on the worcks till the 26th in the night, at which time
we had three batteries ready to open, when the enemy abbandoned
and set fire to the fort. During the time that the enemy remained
they could not keep a hotter fire, for I dare say that fired ten
thousand cannon shott and five hundred bombs and I don’t believe
there has been forty men killed and wounded during that hott fire,
altho’ all the Bombs fell in different parts among us and that we
were nigh point blank of the cannon shott but the line that had
been of so much hurt to us last year saved our men this.</p>

<p class="right">Your most afft. Brother, James Murray.”</p>
</div>

<p>I also add Amherst’s report to Governor James DeLancey:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Camp at Ticonderoga 27th July 1759.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Saturday morning last I embarked with the army at Lake
George, the next day landed without opposition and proceeded to
the saw mills, and took post on the commanding grounds, meeting
only a trifling opposition from the enemy. We lay on our arms all
night and early on the 23rd we continued our march to the ground
which I took possession of in the forenoon, the enemy having
abandoned the lines without destroying them, first having carried
off their effects as well as sent away the greatest part of their
troops. As soon as I was set down before the place and after having
reconnoitered it, I ordered the trenches to be opened and batteries
to be made, which were finished last night, and were to have opened
at break of day, but the enemy did not think proper to wait till
then, having about ten of the clock yesterday evening blown up a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
part of the Fort, and made their escape all to about 20 deserters.
Our loss considering the fire we sustained is inconsiderable. We
have only two officers killed, vis. Colonel Townshend, Deputy Adjutant
General and Ensign Harrison of late Forbe’s.</p>
</div>

<p>Bourlamaque had on receipt of <ins class="corr" id="tn-32" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'orders from Vandreuil'">
orders from Vaudreuil</ins> retired
down Lake Champlain leaving four hundred men under Hebecourt
to defend the fort as long as possible and then to abandon Ticonderoga
and later when pressed Crown Point and to retreat to Isle-oux-Noix
at the outlet of Lake Champlain, where defense was to be
made to the last extremity. When the English battery was ready
to open fire Hebecourt saw that further resistance was useless and
lighting a slow match to the magazine the French escaped down the
lake in their boats and a few hours later an explosion which hurled
one bastion of old Fort Carrillon skyward shook the promontory.
Thus did French Carillon become English Ticonderoga and “Ticonderoga
1758-9” should be among the battle honors to be borne on
the colors of the Black Watch. It is true that these honorary
distinctions are awarded by the King only in case of victory but
Ticonderoga 1758-9 would certainly be as much a victory as “South
Africa 1899-1902,” which has been granted. South Africa was not
all victory and the Black Watch suffered at Magersfontein as it
did at Ticonderoga under Abercrombie.</p>

<p>The length of time elapsed since the battle would also be no
objection to the honor being now granted as it was not until 1910,
two and one half centuries later that the armies that upheld
British honor on the Coast of Morocco were authorized to bear
“Tangier 1662-1680” on their colors and appointments.</p>

FORT EDWARD, 1759</div>
</div>

<p>Ticonderoga is the one place on the American continent where
Great Britain and France, Canada and the United States can all
unite on one common ground. The Yankees and British can meet
here and clasp hands over the time when they once fought together
and there is not even a sectional feeling which detracts from the
unanimity. The North, South, East and West of the United States
all join with equal fervor. Each nation had its defeats here at
different times but each also had its victories. Therefore there
is no battle honor which could be conferred on any British regiment
that would please more people of different nations than “Ticonderoga<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
1758-9.” The fact that there is at present in the village of
Ticonderoga a public library and historical building dedicated to
a British Regiment, even though this same regiment in its line of
duty fought against us in a later war, is sufficient proof that we
consider Ticonderoga of international history and above matters
of local prejudice.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is soon told. Crown Point was captured
and the army was to have moved forward to Isle oux-Noix and to
the St. Lawrence but a succession of storms so delayed operations
that further active movements were abandoned for the remainder
of the season. Amherst profiting by the fatal precipitation of his
predecessor was slow but sure and in this campaign was successful
in every enterprise that he undertook.</p>

<p>After the capture of Crown Point the army under Amherst
was mainly employed in building operations on Lake Champlain,
Fort Amherst at Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga in place of
old Fort Carrillon at Ticonderoga. The Black Watch was stationed
at Crown Point and helped to build Fort Amherst. In November,
they went into camp for the winter and in his report of “Garrisons
and Winter Quarters of His Majesty’s forces in North America
under the command of His Excellency, Major General Amherst,
Headquarters at New York, 15 Dec., 1759” in the Public Record
Office, the stations of the Black Watch were as follows: 1st
Battalion Royal Highland Regiment, 1 company Halfway Brook,
5 companies Fort Edward, 1 company Fort Miller, 1 company
Saratoga, 1 company Stillwater and 1 company Halfmoon, 2d
Battalion Royal Highland Regiment, Albany, one Battalion of
the Inniskilling (27th Foot) and two companies of the Rangers
were left at Crown Point, six companies Late Brig. Gen’l Forbe’s
(17th Foot) at Ticonderoga, and four companies 17th Foot at Fort
George. The following season (1760) the Black Watch was with
Amherst at the capture of Montreal which was the end of the
French domain on the American Continent.</p>

<p>In 1761 the Black Watch with ten regiments embarked for
Barbadoes there to join an armament against Martinique and
Havana. After the surrender of Havana, the first battalion of the
42nd and Montgomery’s Highlanders embarked for New York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
which they reached in the end of October, 1762. Before leaving
Cuba most of the second battalion of the 42nd fit for service were
consolidated with the first, and the remainder shipped to Scotland
where they were reduced the following year.</p>

<p>The Black Watch was stationed at Albany until the summer
of 1763, when they, with a detachment of Montgomery’s Highlanders
and another of the 60th, under command of Col. Henry
Boquet were sent to the relief of Fort Pitt then besieged by the
Indians. The 42nd passed the winter at Fort Pitt and during the
summer of 1764, eight companies were sent with the army of
Boquet against the Ohio Indians. After subduing the Indians
they returned to Fort Pitt, January 1765. The regiment remained
in Pennsylvania until the month of July, 1767, when it embarked
at Philadelphia for Ireland. Such of the men who preferred to
remain in America were permitted to join other regiments. These
volunteers were so numerous that along with those who had been
previously sent home disabled and others discharged and settled in
America, the regiment that returned was very small in proportion
to that which had left Scotland.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to Major Duncan Campbell as
not only would no sketch of the Black Watch of Ticonderoga be
complete without the legend with which his name is associated, but
we are perhaps more interested in him than any other officer of
the Regiment of that time because he lies buried in the cemetry
midway between Hudson Falls (formerly Sandy Hill) and Fort
Edward. The other officers and men who were killed July 8, 1758,
were doubtless buried on the field of battle and if the graves were
ever marked, these marks have long since been destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p>No ghost story is more widely known or better authenticated
than that of Duncan Campbell of Inverawe. It has been made the
subject of an address before this Association by the late Robert O.
Bascom at the meeting of July 30, 1901, and has been repeated in
many forms and in various publications but it will bear still one
more repetition. The following is taken from Parkman’s “Montcalm
and Wolfe” and is the story as was told by Dean Stanley and
endorsed by the family of the hero of the tale:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ancient castle of Inverawe stands by the banks of the
Awe, in the midst of the wild and picturesque scenery <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'of the Westtern'">
of the Western</ins>
Highlands. Late one evening, before the middle of the last
century, as the laird, Duncan Campbell, sat alone in the old hall,
there was a loud knocking at the gate; and, opening it, he saw a
stranger, with torn clothing and kilt besmeared with blood, who in
a breathless voice begged for asylum. He went on to say that he
had killed a man in a fray, and that the pursuers were at his heels.
Campbell promised to shelter him. “Swear on your dirk!”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> said
the stranger; and Campbell swore. He then led him to a secret
recess in the depths of the castle. Scarcely was he hidden when
again there was a loud knocking at the gate, and two armed men
appeared. “Your cousin Donald has been murdered, and we are
looking for the murderer!” Campbell, remembering his oath, professed
to have <ins class="corr" id="tn-35a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'no knowlodge'">
no knowledge</ins> of the fugitive; and the men went on
their way. The laird, in great agitation, lay down to rest in a large
dark room where at length he fell asleep. Waking suddenly in
bewilderment and terror, he saw the ghost of the murdered Donald
standing by his bedside, and heard a hollow voice pronounce the
words: “Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been shed. Shield not the
murderer.” In the morning Campbell went to the hiding place
of the guilty man and told him that he could harbor him no longer.
“You have sworn on your dirk” he replied; and the laird of Inverawe,
greatly perplexed and troubled, made a compromise between
conflicting duties, promised not to betray his guest, led him
to the neighboring mountain (Ben Cruachan) and hid him in a cave.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In the next night, as he lay tossing in feverish slumbers, the
same stern voice awoke him, the ghost of his cousin Donald stood
again at his bedside, and again he heard the same appalling words:
“Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been shed. Shield not the murderer!”
At break of day he hastened, in strange agitation, to the
cave; but it was empty, the stranger had gone. At night, as he
strove in vain to sleep, the vision appeared once more, ghastly pale,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
but less stern of aspect than before. “Farewell, Inverawe!” it said;
“Farewell, till we meet at TICONDEROGA!”</p>

<p>The strange name dwelt in Campbell’s memory. He had
joined the Black Watch, or Forty-Second Regiment, then employed
in keeping order in the turbulent Highlands. In time he became
its major; and, a year or two after the war broke out, he went with
it to America. Here, to his horror, he learned that it was ordered
to the attack of Ticonderoga. His story was well known among
his brother officers. They combined among themselves to disarm
his fears; and when they reached the fatal spot they told him on
the eve of the battle, “This is not Ticonderoga; we are not there
yet; this is Fort George.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But in the morning he came to them
with haggard looks. “I have seen him! You have deceived me!
He came to my tent last night! This is Ticonderoga! I shall die
today!” and his prediction was fulfilled.”</p>
</div>

<p>As will be seen by the preceding pages, Inverawe lived nine
days after the battle and was not even mortally wounded if it had
been possible in those times to have had antiseptic treatment, but
the real point of the legend is that he had been warned of Ticonderoga
when he did not know there was such a place, years before
there was any prospect of his being sent there and when Ticonderoga
was only the Indian name for a point of land on a lake in the
wilderness of a far off continent.</p>

<p>To one interested no place could be more fascinating than old
Inverawe;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> everything connected with it breathes of legend and
romance and naturally this was one of the first places visited in
our Black Watch pilgrimage last summer. Taynuilt, the railroad
station nearest Inverawe is a small village across the Awe and
about a mile away as the crow flies, but to drive to our destination,
one must follow the road two miles up the River to the old bridge
which was being built at the time that the Major left for the war
in America in 1756. The builder was Captain William Pitman
apparently a good friend of Duncan of Inverawe as he charged him
with the safe keeping during his absence of his daughter Janet and
his favorite dog. History does not record what happened to the
dog but the Captain married the daughter and in time Inverawe
became her property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>After crossing the Awe the road turns down the north side of
the River and winds through a magnificent park, some of the trees
of which must certainly have been there before the Major’s time.
This is all the more remarkable because with the exception of the
parks of the private estates, Scotland is nearly a treeless country
and even the mountains and wild land which with us would be
covered with forests, have there only grass and heather. Then at the
end of a delightful four mile drive was old Inverawe house and a
most cordial and hospitable welcome from its present owner.</p>

<p>The old house has had many additions in the past one hundred
and fifty years but the entrance hall and the main part of the
building and particularly the room where Duncan Campbell saw
the ghost, are still very much as they were in his time. We endeavored
to learn as much as possible of the family history of the
Campbells of Inverawe, but like the records of the Black Watch
of that time, there was in 1910, little left but tradition.</p>


<h3><em>The Campbells of Inverawe</em></h3>

<p>Twenty years have passed since the account of the Black
Watch at Ticonderoga as written for the 1910 meeting of the New
York State Historical Association was published, and while we
regret that very little can be added, we are pleased to say that
few corrections have had to be made in the story as then told.
It was thought that the records of the Regiment of the 18th Century
were discovered in 1913 among the military manuscripts in
the Royal United Service Institution, but while they purported
to be the original records, careful examination disclosed that they
had been written early in the nineteenth century so nothing new
was learned of the Regiment of the Ticonderoga period. The preceding
pages therefore are practically unchanged.</p>

<p>The part, however, about the family history of Major Duncan
Campbell of Inverawe has been entirely rewritten. We are indebted
for this additional information to the descendants of Alexander,
a brother of Duncan of Inverawe, to the late Major Sir
Duncan Campbell of Barcaldine, to the late Captain Douglas
Wimberly, and others. No one feature of the Black Watch at
Ticonderoga has been of such general interest as the ghost story
of its Major, Duncan Campbell of Inverawe, and the straightening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
out of the family puzzle which was such a mystery in 1910 has
been a fascinating study.</p>

<p>The Major’s memory has been honored recently by two celebrations.
In 1920 when his bones were moved to the Jane McCrea
enclosure, just inside the main gate of the Union Cemetery between
Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, where his ancient tombstone now
has the protection of a high iron fence, and in 1925 when a monument
to the Black Watch and its Major was unveiled at Fort
Ticonderoga. Both occasions were under the auspices of the St.
Andrews Society of Scots of Glens Falls and vicinity, and the New
York State Historical Association.</p>

<p>Of all the new material which has been found since 1910 none
is so important or so interesting as the following letter from Major
Duncan Campbell of Inverawe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Albany, 14th March, 1758.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I received your letter from Inveraw of the 25th November and
the first from you since we parted, tho I have been informed by
letters that come to hand, of your writing formerly. The State you
sent me of my affairs is not very agreeable nor encouraging for
me to make a retreat that I had in view, and in a little time I
believe might be in my power but I am not disappointed; and
notwithstanding I shall do all in my power to assist you. I am
sorry that no other scheme of living can be accomplished upon
the fund, than the one fixed on; to me it gives uneasiness of minde,
tho I’m sensible the consequence may be worse if it is not followed,
and therefore bear it with concern. I don’t choose to mention my
reasons or enter upon particulars as letters from this part of the
world to yours are lyable to inspection and many accidents. I
see a separation must be that will expose them to the disrespect
and ridicule of many; coud they live together in the way proposed
it might prevent much of that but I can’t hope or expect it from
what I know.</p>

<p>As to my advice or directions with regard to any plan you,
and my other freinds, to whom I fear I have given much trouble
and to whom in any event I shall rekon myself oblig’d there is no
sort of use for them, you are best judges, and as I am well satisfied
that everything will be don and ordered for the best, I shall be
as satisfied with any consequence. I am glade you think of raising
nurseries and planting, I sent from this Country to be forwarded
by Mr. Gatty from Belfast two Barrels of the different kindes of
Timber tree seeds &amp;c. but I doubt they will be too late excepting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the Pines which seed will do when two year old.</p>

<p>Your letter came a few days ago by an advice Ship of War,
which superceeded My Lord Loudoun in the Command and General
Abercrombie appointed in his place, with many other changes and
promotions in our Military affairs in this Continent, how far they
may change our Luck I shall not pretend to judge, but we have
need of some sort of medicine for that end. We have a prospect
of a very warm and vigorous campaign, and I hope it will be successful.
Our Regiment is appointed for the Lewisburgh Expedition,
but as we are so far up in the Country where the Generall is to
have his department and opperations it is yet uncertain but he may
keep us with him; we are all in very good health and compleat for
service.</p>

<p>I cannot yet know what remittance I can make for this year,
some I will and shall, sometime before we take the field or the
midle of May. To prevent a relaps of my last years companion
I travelled to the Southard during the severity of the winter to N.
York and Philadelfia &amp;c. which have had the desyrd effect and
I’m now as chois as ever, but it will not enlarge the remittance.</p>

<p>I have had no letter from Sandy Campbell since Aprile last,
Nor from Jesie since July, I received one from Mr. Richardson
with yours which I shall answer by next Pacquett and tell him so
with my compliments. Lykways please tell Peter Campbell that
his letter came at the same time, and that as Adam Fisher is here
I had are opportunity of enquiring about his son who is at present
out as master, not Capt. of a Privateer there was no such prizes
or Fortoune as Peter believed what may be now I know not but
there is no great prospect of it. This is the only letter I write
by the first Pacquett, so that you may communicate it to my
friends as a proof of my being well and youll in the same course
make my compliments to them all.</p>

<p id="tn-39">I’m sorry that Captain Campbell should make objections to
the payment of his Bill; he brought me 3 <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> for which I cleared
him all his charge and gav <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> at that time 20 guineas over for
his own trouble <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> expense this he knows and will appear by

</div>

<p>The letter bears the Inverawe arms on seal and is endorsed,
probably by the addressee “14th March 1758, from Inveraw concerning
his familie and affairs and Lieut. Collonel Dugd. Campbell’s
Bill.”</p>

<p>This letter will bear reading and re-reading. The first
and to the writer the most important part of the letter was
some financial and family problem. Unfortunately his guarded
and cryptic message caused by the fear that the letter might
be opened by another than the addressee will perhaps leave
it always an unsolved mystery. It would be interesting to
know what success attended the planting of the two barrels
of timber seed. His guess that the Black Watch might be used
in the Ticonderoga campaign rather than the Lewisburgh as planned,
proved correct. It would be interesting to know what the
malady of the previous winter was, to prevent a relapse of which
it had been necessary to travel to the Southard. The letter closes
with another financial problem. If he means that he was allowed
ten or fifteen dollars per man for the thousand men in the Regiment,
that would be a very sizable income for those days and the bill
must have been a large one. The allowance, however, might have
been for recruits secured or some other regimental activity. But
aside from the interesting contents of this letter its real value is
that it gives an opportunity to learn something of the character of
its writer. One can read between the lines that Duncan of Inverawe
was a reserved man of a strong but a quiet, kindly nature, he
would suffer loss himself rather than make trouble for others, and
after having done his best was willing to take whatever came
without complaint. It quite matches the Inverawe of the ghost
story who promised to protect a fugitive and then stood by his
oath even though the refugee was the murderer of his cousin. The
reader of this letter can not help but feel drawn towards its writer.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i040.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>The Black Watch of Canada at the dedication of the Black Watch
Memorial Tablet July 8, 1925, the inscription of which reads:</p>

<p>A. D. 1925. The Saint Andrews Society of Glens Falls, N. Y., erected
this tablet to commemorate the heroic gallantry of the 42nd Regiment of
Foot, better known as “The Royal Highlanders” or “THE BLACK WATCH”
who on July 8, 1758, lost here in killed and wounded over six hundred of
the thousand men engaged. Mortally wounded on that day was their Major,
DUNCAN CAMPBELL OF INVERAWE, the hero of one of the most noted
ghost stories of Scottish history and of Robert Louis Stevenson’s poem,
“Ticonderoga.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now what was the immediate family and what was the background
of our hero. One version of the ghost story was that he
made his will the night before the battle, but no sensible man waits
until death is at the door for this very important transaction and
we find the following in Vol. XV, Abstract of Entry in Sheriff
Court Books of Argyll at Inveraray.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Disposition by Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe to Lieut.
Dugald Campbell, his eldest son procreated between him and Mrs.
Jean Campbell, his wife, whom, failing, to Lieut. Alexander Campbell,
his second son, whom failing, Duncan Campbell, his third and
youngest son, whom failing, to any other sons he may lawfully
have, and the heirs male of their bodies in succession, whom failing,
to Janet Campbell, his only daughter now in life procreated between
him and the said Mrs. Jean Campbell, of his whole lands
and estate of Inverawe and others, under certain reservations; dated
at Glasgow 17th April, 1756; witnesses, John Campbell of Cloichombie,
Alexander Campbell in Achalion, and others.”</p>
</div>

<p>This establishes Inverawe’s family and we will see what became
of them. Dugald was appointed 2nd Lieutenant in the 21st or Royal
North British Fuziliers, December 28, 1755, joined his Regiment
at Gibraltar in 1756, died and was succeeded by John Wallace,
March 1st, 1758.</p>

<p>Alexander was appointed Lieutenant in the Black Watch Jan.
28, 1756, was wounded at Ticonderoga and invalided to Glasgow
where he was promoted to a Captaincy in the Argyllshire Regiment
of Fencible men, July 21, 1759, died unmarried Feb. 8, 1760 and
was buried in Grey Friers Burying Ground. A powder horn said
to have belonged to Lt. Alexander and bearing the coat-of-arms
of the Campbells of Inverawe is at the McCord Museum of McGill
University in Montreal.</p>

<p>Duncan, third son of Inverawe, is still a mystery but the fact
that Janet was proven heir to Inverawe February 5, 1762 would
seem to show that he had died without issue before that date.</p>

<p>Major Duncan, born Nov. 22, 1702, married March 20, 1732
Jean, daughter of Col. Alexander Campbell of Finab. She died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]<br /><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
at Edinburgh August 20, 1761. When Janet succeeded to Inverawe
in 1762 therefore her father, her mother and three brothers had
all predeceased her&mdash;a tragic mortality in six short years. There
is a family tradition that Major Duncan mortgaged Inverawe to
his brother-in-law, Col. Robert Campbell of Finab and Monzie
and that according to old Scottish law the property was handed
over to the man who advanced the money until the rental had
paid off the debt, and that this arrangement was called a wadset.
Whether Col. Campbell of Finab and Monzie acquired the property
by wadset or purchase, it passed into his hands soon after Janet
proved her title and it is said that when she left the estate she
washed her hands in a bottle of wine at the border, which we were
told was an old Highland custom. The owner of Inverawe in 1910
was a descendant of Col. Robert Campbell of Finab and Monzie,
a Mrs. Campbell of Dunstaffnage. Since then we are informed it
was purchased by the late Mr. James Currie and is now for sale
to settle his estate.</p>

<p>Janet who married Capt. William Pitman, had only one daughter,
Susan, who died unmarried. So with her the descendants of
Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe are at an end.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting tale about an Inverawe cup. It
seems that in 1714 the three brothers, Archibald of Inverawe,
Dugald of Shirvan, and Alexander of Kilmartin, each got a silver
cup. The Kilmartins always kept their cup but both those of
Inverawe and Shirvan were lost. This was such a grief to the
Inverawes that the fact was often mentioned. On one occasion
a friend who had heard of this cup was hunting in Ireland and
stopped at a wretched little inn to get a drink for himself and his
horse. The place was so disreputable looking that he would not
go in but had his drink brought out to him. It came in a battered
old metal cup and on the chance that it might be of value, he
bought it from the landlord. To his great pleasure he found on
having it cleaned that it was the long lost Inverawe cup. He had
an inscription put on it, recording the finding, and sent it to
Archibald Campbell of Blackhouse, a nephew of Major Duncan,
and the representative at that time of the Inverawe family. The
cup is still a treasured possession of the descendants of this Archibald,
the Campbells of Arduaine, Lochgilphead.</p>

THE INVERAWE CUP</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>The will of the Archibald of Inverawe of the Silver Cup and
father of Major Duncan Campbell, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1727, February 23rd&mdash;Disposition by Archibald Campbell of
Inveraw to Duncan Campbell, his eldest lawful son, and the heirs
male of his body, whom failing, to Dugall Campbell, his second
lawful son, and his heirs male, whom failing, Lachlan Campbell,
his third son, and Alexander Campbell, his fourth son, whom all
failing, the heirs of the Granter and Janet McLean, his spouse,
whom failing, his heirs of any other marriage of his lands of
Inveraw, Drumchoise, Dalneass, etc., with certain exceptions,
including a life rent right granted by the deceased Archibald
Campbell of Inveraw to Lilias Campbell, his spouse, now spouse to
Angus Campbell of Dunstagnage; dated at Inveraw 14th February
1722.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another interesting fact in the Inverawe annals is that Dugald
Campbell of London in the parish of Saint Martin’s, Westminster,
and County of Middlesex, by his will bearing date the 2nd day of
June 1718, gave to old decayed men and young women of Campbell
of Inverawe’s family, the sum of £300, and that this “Inverawe
Annuity Fund” since augmented, is still administered by Trustees
chosen from the Inverawe heirs.</p>

<p>The present known Campbells who are proud to claim that
they are of the Clan Inverawe are descended from Alexander,
brother of Duncan, the fourth son of Archibald, as named in the
foregoing will. Alexander was born in 1710 and married Ann
Somerville in 1747. If all of the descendants of this union have
been of as fine, high character as those whom we have been privileged
to meet, the world has indeed been richer for the Campbells
of Inverawe.</p>


<h3><em>Family Tree of The Campbells of Inverawe</em></h3>

<p>The family does not seem to be entirely in agreement on the
line back of the 18th Century. The following is gathered from different
branches. One version is that the Inverawes descended from
Sir Archibald Campbell of Lochow, whose son Colin was knighted
by Alexander III, 1280, and died 1294. His son, Niel or Nigel of
Lochow, died 1360, and <em>his</em> son, Dugald or Duncan was the 1st
“Inverawe” and ancestor of the Clan Dhonnachie Campbells. He
got a grant of the estate of Inveraw and Cruachan from David II,
1330. A later Inveraw got a grant of lands from Queen Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
1558. With the exception of a gap of about 60 years from 1460 or
so to 1510, we have a complete record of “Inveraws” practically
an unbroken succession from father to son.</p>

<p>Another version is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Archibald, c/v from 1st Earl of Argyll</p>

<p>Dougal, c/v 22.11.1485, from 2nd Earl. Sasine Des. 1486. Officer
of Over Lochow to the Earl. (Inverawe deeds)</p>

<p>Archibald, signs Archibald McCoul McConachie of Inverawe 1519,
(Thanes of Cawdor), c/v from 2nd Earl as heir to Dugal
(Inverawe deeds) married Margaret Campbell.</p>

<p>Dougal, (Inverawe 1548-1562). (Register of Decreets and Acts)
said to have married a dau. of Lochnell.</p>

<p>Archibald, (1562-1567 or 1576) married Margaret C. dau. of Dougal
C. of Ardcullour, sister of Sir James C. VIth of Ardkinklas.
(A. Charters)</p>

<p>Dougal, (1576 or 1567-1583) married Christian Carswell, dau. (or
granddaughter) of Bishop Carswell. Relict of Dougal 1587.
She afterward married Neill Campbell, Bishop of Lismore.</p>

<p>Archibald, (1583-1650)</p>

<p>Dougal, (1650-1674), burned “Bonnie House of Airlie” 1640. married
1st, Agnes, dau. of Sir Robert C. of Glenarguhy (Braedalbane)
2nd, Janet, dau. of Rory McNeill of Barra.</p>

<p>Archibald, (1674-1705), son of Dougal and Agnes. Married 1st,
Mary, dau. of Hector McNeill of Thayneis. 2nd, Lilias, dau.
of Sir James C. of Lawers.</p>

<p>Archibald, (1705-1730) married Janet McLean of Torloisk. Served
heir to Cattinis 1700, later Inverawe, etc. Received Inverawe
cup 1714.</p>

<p>Duncan (1730-1758), Major Black Watch, married Jane Campbell
of Finab.</p>

<p class="pfs100">COMPARISON OF LOSSES OF BLACK WATCH AT TICONDEROGA
WITH THOSE OF OTHER WARS.</p>

<p>In the “Regimental Losses in the American Civil War, 1861,
1865. A treatise in the extent and nature of the mortuary losses
in the Union Regiments, with full and exhaustive statistics compiled
from the official records on file on the State Military Bureaus
and at Washington, by William F. Fox, Lieut. Col. U. S. V., president
of the Society of the 12th Army Corps; late president of the
107th New York Veteran Volunteer Association. Albany Publishing
Company, Albany, N. Y., 1899.” The writer states that he has
examined the records of 2,000 regiments of the Union Army and on
page 2 he says, “The one regiment in all the Union Army which
sustained the greatest loss in battle during the American Civil
War was the 5th New Hampshire Infantry. It lost 295 men, killed
or mortally wounded in action during the four years of service
from 1861 to 1865. It served in the first division, second corps.
This division was commanded successively by General Richardson,
Hancock, Caldwall, Barlow and Miles and any regiment that followed
the fortunes of these men was sure to find plenty of bloody
work cut out for it. Its loss includes 18 officers killed, a number
far in excess of the usual proportions and indicates that the men
were bravely led.”</p>

<p>“There were 34 regiments of the Union Army whose casualties
in killed, wounded or missing amounted to 58 per cent or over of
the men engaged in one battle in each case, however, there was
not a full regiment engaged. For example, the 1st Minnesota at
Gettysburg, which was the highest per centage, had 47 killed and
168 wounded, or a total loss of 215 out of 262 men engaged. This
is a loss of 82 per cent.</p>

<p>The 9th Illinois at Shiloh had 61 killed, 300 wounded and 5
missing, a total of 63.3 per cent.</p>

<p>The Light Brigade which has been immortalized by Tennyson
took 673 officers and men into that charge at Balaklava in
which 113 were killed and 134 wounded, a total of 247 or 36.7 per
cent.</p>

BEARING DATE FEB<sup>Y</sup> 1<sup>ST</sup> 1759, CAUSED THIS MONUMENT TO
BE ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE AUGUSTUS LORD
VISCOUNT HOWE, BRIGADIER GENERAL OF HIS MAJESTY’S

SERVICES AND MILITARY VIRTUES, AND OF THE AFFECTION

HIS LOSS; TO HIS FAMILY IT IS IRREPARABLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>The heaviest loss in the German army of the Franco-Prussian
war was the 16th Infantry (3d Westphalian) at Mars LaTour
which had 509 killed, 619 wounded, 365 missing, a total of 1,484 or
49.4 per cent. out of 3,000 men. The regiments of the German
army had 3,000 men.”</p>

<p>The above are the greatest casualties suffered in three great
wars taken from a book compiled by an authority who had made
a study of the subject. Compare with these the loss of the Black
Watch at Ticonderoga given by Col. Stewart of Garth as 8 officers,
9 sergeants and 297 men killed and 17 officers, 10 sergeants and
306 soldiers wounded or a casualty of 647 (64.7 per cent) out of
the 1,000 men of the 42nd reported by General Abercrombie at
Lake George, June 29, 1758.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>1881 (from) First Battalion “The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.”</p>

<p>Nickname&mdash;“The Lumps.”</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;Formed from three Companies of the Inniskilling forces. It is
unique in using the old Irish war-pipes. While employed on the Isthmus
of Darien all but nine of six hundred men succumbed. For distinguished
gallantry at St. Lucia, in 1696, it was directed that the French garrison in
marching out should lay down their arms to the 27th, other marks of
favor being likewise accorded to the officers and men of the regiment.</p>

<p class="pfs100">42nd.</p>

<p>1749-58, 42nd Regiment of Foot (The Highland Regiment).</p>

<p>1758-1861, 42nd (or Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot. Also
“Lord John Murray’s,” 1758 and 59.</p>

<p>1881 (from) 1st Battalion The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).</p>

<p>Regimental Badges-“The Royal Cypher within the Garter.”
The badge and motto of the Order of the Thistle. Also (in each
of the four corners) the Royal Cypher ensigned with the Imperial
Crown. Also “<ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'The Spinx'">
The Sphinx</ins>” (for Egypt, 1801).</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;The 1st Battalion of this famous corps, the oldest Highland
regiment in the British army, was raised from six Independent companies
of Highlanders. Its sombre dress of black, blue, and green tartan gave
rise to its popular name. To enumerate its services is simply to narrate
the military history of Great Britain since the early part of the last century.
Hardly a campaign has been conducted, or a battle fought, in which
the Black Watch&mdash;one battalion or the other, or both in company&mdash;has not
participated; always with bravery, and frequently with conspicuous gallantry.
Thereto its records of services abundantly testifies. At Fontenoy,
Ticonderoga, and at Bushy Run “extraordinary and unexampled” gallantry
was shown. It received Royal distinction in its change of title in 1758,
and was privileged to wear the red heckle in the bonnet, in recognition
of its conduct at the battle of Guildermalsen in 1795. In Egypt (in 1801,
for which it bears “The Sphinx”), before Alexandria, it captured the
Standard of the French Invincible Legion. Since then it has heaped fame
on fame, and added “honor” to “honor” to its colours. Nor has the 2nd
Battalion (raised in Perthshire in 1758 as the second Battalion of the 42nd,
but, renumbered, long known as the 73rd prior to the territorial restoration
of the ancient status) failed to win fresh laurels as occasion arose. At
Mangalore (1783) against Tippoo Sahib, and side by side with the senior
Battalion at Waterloo, in the Netherlands, in the Indian Mutiny, and in the
Kaffir wars of 1846-53, it has worthily sustained the undying fame of the
regiment. Recent events in South Africa show that neither the officers
nor the men of today have lost one iota of that traditional dash, determination,
and the bravery which have won for the Black Watch so glorious a
place in British military annals.</p>

<p class="pfs100">44th.</p>

<p>1751-82, The 44th Regiment of Foot. Also 1758, “General
Abercrombie’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>1881 (from) The First Battalion “The Essex Regiment.”</p>

<p>Nicknames&mdash;“The Two Fours” (of the 44th). “The Little
Fighting Fours,” (the regiment saw hard service in the Peninsula,
and its men were of small average stature). “The Pompadours”
and “Saucy Pompeys.” (Tradition relates that when the facings
were changed in 1764 (the crimson not wearing well) the Colonel
desired Blue, but the authorities objecting, he chose Purple, a
favorite color of Madame de Pompadour, a mistress of Louis XV,
of France).</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;The 44th captured an Eagle of the 62nd French Infantry at
Salamanica.</p>
</div>


<p class="pfs100">46th.</p>

<p>1751-82, The 46th Regiment of Foot. Also 1758 “Lieut. Gen.
Thomas Murray’s.”</p>

<p>1881 (from) Second Battalion “Duke of Cornwall’s Light infantry.”</p>

<p>Nicknames&mdash;These pertain to the late 46th; “Murray’s Buck’s”
(from Colonel name (1743-64) and its smart appearance on home
duty in Scottish Royal livery). “The Surprisers” (from an incident
(1777) in the American War). “The Lacedemonians” (its Colonel
once when under fire, made a disciplinarian speech concerning the
Lacedemonians). Also in early days, “The Edinburgh Regiment.”
“The Red Feathers.” “The Docs” (the initials).</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Note.&mdash;“The Two Feathers” is a distinction of the 46th, a Light company
of which, in 1777, with others were brigaded as “The Light Battalion.”
The Americans were so harrassed by the Brigade that they vowed
“No Quarter.” In derision, to prevent mistakes, the Light Battalion dyed
their feathers red; the 46th Foot alone has retained the distinction.</p>
</div>


<p class="pfs100">55th</p>

<p>1757-82, The 55th Regiment of Foot. Also “Lord Howe’s” in
1858 and “Prideaux’s” in 1759.</p>

<p>1881 (from) Second Battalion “The Border Regiment.”</p>

<p>Nickname&mdash;“The Two Fives” (to the 55th for its number).</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;The Dragon of China is on the Regimental Badge of the 55th
in honor of the victorious campaign in China in 1840-42.</p>

<p>1881 (from) Second Battalion “The Border Regiment.”</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;This regiment, though possessing no “Colors,” bears more honors
than any other regiment, the Highland Light Infantry coming next
with twenty-nine. Motto, “Swift and Bold,” bestowed according to tradition
by General Wolfe in recognition of its conduct at Quebec.</p>
</div>


<p class="pfs100">80th.</p>

<p>1758-64, The 80th (Light-armed) Regiment of Foot. Also
“Gage’s.” (Disbanded 1764).</p>


<p class="pfs100">The Royal Regiment of Artillery.</p>

<p>One arm or other of this branch of the Service has, obviously,
taken part in every campaign; a particularized list is therefore
unnecessary. The guns are the “Colours” of the Artillery, and as
such are entitled to all “parade honours.” Formerly, regimental
honors appear to have been worn by certain companies. Amongst
such are “Niagara,” “Leipsic,” “Waterloo,” and “The Dragon of
China.”</p>

<p>Nicknames&mdash;“The Gunners;” “The Four-wheeled Hussars” (of
the Royal Horse Artillery).</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;Trains of artillery seem to have been raised in the time of
Henry VIII., and up to 1716 appear to have been disbanded after each campaign.
In 1716 several companies received permanent corporate existence,
since which exigencies of modern warfare have led to an enormous increase
in the number of batteries. But from first to last, the record of the
Royal Artillery has been one of distinction, and it may fitly be said to
share the honors of all other regiments. The Royal Irish Artillery were
absorbed in 1801, and the East India Company’s Artillery in 1858.</p>

“Royals.”</p>

<p>1881 (from) The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Nickname&mdash;“Pontius Pilate’s Body-Guard.” It is a legend
of the Regiment that the Romans carried off a number of wild,
war-like Highlanders as prisoners after their conquest of Britain,
and these men and their descendants became soldiers of the Roman
Empire and as such they guarded the tomb of Our Saviour after
the crucifixion. This Scottish company, for it only consisted of
one hundred men under a centurion, was kept distinct from the
Roman Army proper. At the time of the crucifixion they were
called Pontius Pilate’s Scots Guards, and their descendants were
the nucleus of the First Royal Scots in later years.</p>

<div class="blockquotzz">

<p>Notes.&mdash;The oldest Regiment of Foot in the British Army. Traditionally
regarded as the ancient body-guard of the Scottish kings, this famous
corps was in the service of Sweden, as “Hepburn’s Regiment,” from 1625
to 1633; and in that of France from 1633 to 1678, when (under Dumbarton)
it came to England. It received its title in 1684 in recognition of the capture
of a Colour from the Moors at Tangier. At Sedgemoor (1685) it also
captured the Duke of Monmouth’s Standard.</p>

<p class="pfs100">17th.</p>

<p>1751-82, The 17th Regiment of Foot. Also “Forbes.”</p>

<p class="pfs100">PROVINCIAL REGIMENTS AT TICONDEROGA.</p>

<p>(The writer will have to admit that this list is more or less
incomplete, even the N. Y. State Library at Albany had only scattered
items. It would seem as if this would be a good subject for
an article for some future meeting of the Association and any
information will be gratefully received).</p>


<p class="pfs100">1758.</p>

<p>The New York Colonial Manuscripts, edited by Callaghan,
page 732, in the list of regiments having officers wounded at the
battle of July 8, 1758, gives the following regiments: Col. DeLancey’s,
New York; Col. Babcock’s, Rhode Island; Col. Fitche’s,
Connecticut; Col. Worcester’s, Connecticut; Col. Bagley’s, Massachusetts;
Col. Partridge’s, Massachusetts; Col. Preble’s, Massachusetts;
Col. Johnston’s, New Jersey. <ins class="corr" id="tn-62" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Parkmen mentions'">
Parkman mentions</ins> Col. Bradstreet
with his regiment of boatmen, armed and drilled as soldiers
and it is also certain that Roger’s Rangers were with the expedition.</p>

<p>The year book of the Maine Chapter of the Society of Colonial
Wars for 1900 gives much information in regard to Col. Preble’s
regiment, Maine being in 1758 a part of Massachusetts. Mention
is made in this article of regiments officered by “Col. Doty, Col.
Joseph Williams, Col. Nickols, Col. Whitings.”</p>

<p>Also in the New York Colonial Manuscripts, Vol. 10, P. 827
it mentions a force of about 3,000 men nearly all of whom were
provincials, under Col. Bradstreet, in the expedition against Fort
Frontinac after the battle of July 8, 1758, and of the number of
soldiers engaged, the list is given as “New Yorkers 1112, Col.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Williams’ regiment 413, Col. Douty’s 248, Rhode Island 318, and
Jersey 418.”</p>

<p>It is not clear whether these regiments were at the battle of
Ticonderoga and were not mentioned in list page 732 of the New
York Colonial Manuscripts because none of the officers were
wounded, or whether they were the same regiments but with
different officers, a change having been made after the battle.</p>


<p class="pfs100">1759</p>

<p>The provincial regiments mentioned in Commissary Wilson’s
Orderly Book as being in the Ticonderoga expedition of 1759 are
as follows: Col. Lyman’s, Connecticut; Col. Whiting’s, Connecticut;
Col. Worcester’s, Connecticut; Col. Fitch’s, Connecticut; Col.
Willard’s, Massachusetts; Col. Ruggle’s, Massachusetts; Col.
Lovell’s, New Hampshire; Col. Schuyler’s, New Jersey; Col. Babcock’s,
Rhode Island.</p>

<p>James Abercrombie was promoted to a captaincy in the 42nd
or 1st Battalion of the Royal Highlanders on the 16th of February,
1756. On the 5th of May, 1759, he was appointed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" id="tn-63" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'aid de camp'">
aide de camp</ins></span>
to Maj. Gen. Amherst, with whom he made the campaigns of
that and the following year. On the 25th of July, 1760, he was
appointed Major of the 78th or Fraser’s Highlanders and in
September following was employed by Gen. Amherst in communicating
to the Marquis de Vaudreuil the conditions preparatory to
the surrender of Montreal and in obtaining the signature of that
governor to them. (Knox’s Journal). The 78th having been disbanded
in 1763, Major Abercrombie retired on half pay. On the
27th of March, 1770, he again entered active service as Lt. Colonel
of the 22nd Regiment then serving in America under the command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of Lt. Col. Gage and was killed in the memorable Battle of Bunker
Hill on the 17th of June, 1775.</p>

served that year against the Pretender. Was made prisoner of war
at Preston Pans, 21st Sept. 1745 and sent on parole to Perth. Was
appointed lieutenant Dec. 1, 1746. He obtained a Company 13th
of May, 1755, and the next year came to America, where he shared
the difficulties and honors of the Regiment. In June, 1759, he was
appointed Major for the campaign under Amherst, and was actively
employed at the Head of the Grenadiers and Rangers, clearing the
way for the army up the Lakes. He became major in the army
15th August, 1762, and went on half-pay on the reduction of the
regiment in 1763, having obtained a grant of 5,000 acres of land at

<p>Extract from the Memorial of Captain Duncan Campbell,
American Loyalist Claims.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Humbly Sheweth, that he was a native of Great Britain and
he was appointed Ensign in the 42nd Highlanders 26 January
1756, in which Corps he served the war before last in America
and the West Indies. And in August 1763 the Regiment was
ordered on an expedition to the relief of Fort Pitt, then invested
by the savages.</p>

<p>On the march he was severely wounded at the battle of Bushy
Run, and for a long time rendered unfit for service. (In this
skirmishing warfare the troops suffered much from the want of
water and the extreme heat of the weather) which occasioned his
retiring on half pay in 1764.</p>

<p>He soon thereafter settled at Fredricksburg, Dutchess Co. in
the Prov. of New York (in 1769) and purchased a valuable track
of land from Colonel Beverly Robinson and others on good terms.
In 1775 he was Colonel of Militia and Magistrate for the said
county.</p>

<p>That at the commencement of the troubles he took an early
and decided part in favor of His Majesty’s government, which
rendered him so obnoxious to the popular party where he dwelt
that he was obliged to fly to New York, to save his life, from the
family and abandon his property in June 1775. That soon after
his arrival there he engaged as an officer in the 2nd Battalion
Highland Emigrant’s in which he continued doing duty until the
cessation of hostilities, and consequent reduction of the Regiment
in Nova Scotia, in which Province he now dwells. (2 <ins class="corr" id="tn-66a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Jannary 1784'">
January 1784</ins>).</p>

<p>That early in June 1775 he got on board the Asia ship of war
(64 gun frigate) then stationed in New York and soon after was
joined by some recruits he had engaged to follow him. In July
thereafter he went to Boston where Gen. Gage then Commander-in-Chief,
gave him command of an armed transport in which he
returned to New York where he enlisted and received on board
about 60 more recruits. That in September he returned again to
Boston where he left all his recruits except 26 which were left on
board as Marines, on the 8 October he was sent back on the same
service. But on the 16 of the same month was unfortunately shipwrecked
on the coast of New Jersey.</p>

<p>On this service he lost all his money and baggage to the
amount of £100. This loss His Excellency Sir William Howe, then
Commander-in-Chief, would not think of reimbursing at the time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
In consequence of the shipwreck he and his party had the misfortune
to be made prisoners and was carried to Philadelphia where
he was fourteen months in a small apartment of <ins class="corr" id="tn-67" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the dismal goal'">
the dismal gaol</ins>
where he contracted a sickness which was likely to prove fatal to
him.</p>

<p>How soon he was taken his family were turned out of doors
and deprived of everything they had except some wearing apparell.
The distressed situation of the family so driven from their home
may be easier felt than described. It brought on for a beginning
the untimely death of an amiable wife, and deprived his five infant
children of a mother’s care whereby they for some time became
objects of compassion which he was unable to rescue them from.
Until he was exchanged and joined his Regiment (in January 1777)
he thereafter continued to serve during the war.</p>

<p>John Campbell, of Duneaves, Perthshire, was originally a
private in the Black Watch. In 1743, he was presented, with
Gregor McGregor, to George II, as a specimen of the Highland
soldier and performed at St. James the broadsword exercise and that
of the Lochaber axe, before his Majesty and a number of General
officers. Each got a gratuity of a guinea, which they gave to the
porter at the gate of the palace as they passed out. Mr. Campbell
obtained an Ensigncy in 1745 for his bravery at the battle of
Fontenoy; was promoted to be Captain-Lieutenant, 16th February,
1756, and landed in New York the following June. He was among
the few resolute men who forced their way into the work at
Ticonderoga, on the 8th of July, where he was killed.</p>

<p>He married Marianna St. Lucan (date not given) and died
Montreal, 23rd June 1795.</p>

<p>“In the course of a long and meritorious service with his
Regiment, the 42nd Highlanders, in all its campaigns from the
Rebellion in 1745 to the attack on Ticonderoga, where he was
wounded on the 8th July, 1758, and the conquest of Canada, Martinique,
and Havanna. He subsequently served in the expedition
commanded by General Burgoyne, at the head of a number of
Indians, and was distinguished for his spirited conduct as an officer,
adorned by that elegance and politeness which mark the accomplished
gentleman and his virtues in private life endeared him to
his family and companions.</p>

<p>His remains were attended to the grave in a manner suitable
to his rank. Not only by a very numerous assembly of citizens
of all ranks, but by a large body of Indian warriors, whose very
decent behavior evinced the sincerity with which they partook of
the universal regret occasioned by the loss of so very respectable
a member of society.”</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>James Murray.</em></p>

<p>James Murray, second son of Lord George Murray, by his
marriage with Amelia Murray, heiress of Strowan and Glencarse,
and grandson of the first Duke of Atholl, was born at Tullibardine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
on the 19th of March, 1734, and it is interesting to know that Lord
John Murray, who was destined in after years to be his colonel,
was called upon to be his godfather. A commission as Lieutenant
in the Saxon Grenadier Guards was obtained for him in 1749, and
he joined his regiment in 1751. He served against the forces of
Frederick the Great until the Saxon Army capitulated at Pirna on
the Elbe in October, 1756. He was released on parole and returned
to Scotland in 1757 and on the nomination of his uncle, James
Duke of Atholl, was given a captain’s commission in the Black
Watch and was placed in command of one of the three additional
companies then being raised for service in America. He reached
New York in April, 1758, and commanded Captain Reid’s company
in the unsuccessful attack on Ticonderoga&mdash;his own company having
been left in garrison at Fort Edward. He was wounded but
was soon able to return to duty and took part in the successful
expedition of 1759 to Lake Champlain. Toward the close of that
year he was given command&mdash;by Lord John Murray’s desire&mdash;of
the Grenadier Company of the newly-raised 2nd Battalion, and
with this battalion he served in the advance on Montreal in 1760
and in the capture of Martinique in 1762. He was wounded here
and invalided home and was on sick leave for more than six years.
He rejoined the Black Watch in 1768 and in 1769 was appointed
Captain-lieutenant in the 3rd Foot Guards, obtaining his promotion
as Captain and Lieutenant-colonel the following year. In 1772 he
was elected member of Parliament for Perthshire, a position which
he held for twenty-two years. He was appointed Governor of
Upnor Castle in 1775 and Fort William in 1780, but these were
merely nominal posts and did not interfere with his other duties.
In 1776 he bought Strowan (originally the property of his mother),
from his nephew, the fourth Duke of Atholl.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the War of Independence, Col. Murray
offered to raise a regiment of Highlanders for service in America,
but this offer was refused, and in March, 1777, he was sent out to
join the brigade of Guards under General Howe in New Jersey.
He was with Lord Cornwallis at Quibbletown and presumably took
part in the actions at Brandywine and Germantown in 1777. He
spent the following winter in quarters at Philadelphia, and left
America in the summer of 1778 and joined the Atholl Highlanders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in Ireland in September of that year, of which regiment he was
given the command. This regiment remained in Ireland during
the war, at the conclusion of which it was disbanded. James
Murray was appointed Lieutenant-colonel-commandant of the 78th
Highlanders in 1783, but as he was already a general officer he
never did any duty with this regiment. After 1783 General
Murray resided a good deal at Strowan; in 1786 he was promoted
full Colonel of the 78th (by that time the 72nd), and in 1793 he was
made Lieutenant-general. In March, 1794, he felt himself obliged
to resign his seat in Parliament owing to ill health and a few days
later&mdash;on the 19th of March&mdash;he died in London and was buried
in St. Margaret’s, Westminster.</p>

<p>Of Lord George Murray’s three sons, General James seems to
have been the one who most resembled his father. He had inherited
the Jacobite General’s sympathetic knowledge of Highland character,
something of his pride, and the same affectionate disposition.
And that he had at least a share of his father’s determination,
and presence of mind is shown by two anecdotes which have
been handed down with regard to him. One of these refers to his
earlier days, and is to the effect that, having been attacked by a
highwayman one night that he was driving over a heath near
London, he leant out of the window of the chaise, “groped in the
dark for the ears of his assailant’s horse,” and with the brief but
expressive exclamation. “Thereut’s-” fired a shot which ended the
highwayman’s career. The other relates that during the Gordon
Riots of 1780 Colonel James Murray was seated next Lord George
Gordon in the House of Commons at the very moment at which the
mob threatened to break into the House. Colonel Murray with a
soldier’s instinct drew his sword, pointed it at Lord George, and
notwithstanding that he was his cousin, declared his intention of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
running him through the body if a single one of the rioters should
enter. His promptness saved the situation, but he had committed
a breach of the privileges of the House and was ordered to apologize
on bended knee to the Speaker. Colonel Murray made the required
amende, but on rising from his knee took out his handkerchief and
dusted it, remarking, “Damned Dirty House this; sooner it’s cleaned
out the better.”</p>

<hr class="r20a" />

<p>Stewart of Garth gives the following in regard to General Murray’s
wound, received at the capture of Martinique; (page 126, Vol. 10.)</p>

<p>“The musket ball entered his left side, under the lower rib, passed up
through the left lobe of the lung, (as ascertained after his death) crossed
his chest, and mounting up to his right shoulder, lodged under the scapula.
His case being considered desperate, the only object of the surgeon was
to make his situation as easy as possible for, the few hours they supposed
he had to live; but, to the great surprise of all, he was on his legs in a
few weeks, and, before he reached England, was quite recovered, or at
least his health and appetite were restored. He was never afterwards,

<p class="pfs100"><em>Lord John Murray.</em></p>

<p>Lord John Murray, born on the 14th of April, 1711, was the
eldest son of John, first Duke of Atholl, by his second wife, the
Hon. Mary Ross, and half-brother to John, Marquess of Tullibardine,
and Lord George Murray. He became an ensign in the 3rd
Foot Guards (now the Scots Guards) in 1727, and a captain in the
same regiment in 1738. Immediately after the mutiny of the
regiment in 1743 he applied for the colonelcy in the 42nd or Black
Watch, but he did not obtain the appointment he so greatly desired
until two years later. In July, 1743, he was appointed first aide-de-camp
to George II and was in attendance on the King in
Germany at the close of the Dettingen campaign, but returned to
England without having taken part in any engagements. In April
1745, when at last gazetted colonel of the Black Watch, he
proceeded to join his regiment in Flanders, but arrived too late
for Fontenoy. He distinguished himself, however, during the
subsequent retreat of the British army to Brussels, by his defence of
a pass which the French attacked by night. For this service he was
publicly thanked by the Duke of Cumberland. In 1745 he returned
home with his regiment but in 1747 he was in the Netherlands
taking part in the attempted relief of Hulst. After the surrender
of the town by the Dutch Governor, Lord John commanded the rear-guard
in the retreat to Welsharden, and shortly afterwards, having
been ordered to take part in the defence of Bergen-op-Zoom, he
was placed in command of the British troops in the lines there. At
the close of operations he received a message of approbation from
the King.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="right">From “A Military History of Perthshire”</p>
Lord John Murray, Colonel the Black Watch, 1745 to 1787</div>
</div>

<p>In 1755 he was promoted major-general, and in 1758 lieutenant-general,
but although he offered his services more than once,
he was not employed abroad during the Seven Years’ War. He
took the keenest interest, however, in all the exploits of his regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and worked hard to raise a second battalion in 1758. Stewart
of Garth tells us that when the men who had been disabled at
Ticonderoga appeared before the Board of Chelsea to claim their
pensions, Lord John went with them and explained their case in
such a manner to the commissioners that they were all successful.
He gave them money, got them a free passage to Perth, and
offered a house and garden to all who chose to settle on his estate.
General Stewart also describes how, when the 42nd at last returned
from America in 1767, Lord John, who had been for weeks at Cork
awaiting its arrival, marched into that town at its head.</p>

<p>Lord John was a great deal with the regiment while it was
quartered in Ireland, and, according to Stewart of Garth, was
“ever attentive to the interest of the officers and vigilant that
their promotion should not be interrupted by ministerial or other
influence.” He was also “unremitting in his exertions to procure
the appointment of good officers, and of officers who understood
perfectly the peculiar dispositions and character of the men.” For
this reason he strenuously endeavored to exclude all but the members
of Scots&mdash;and more especially Highland&mdash;families. He was
equally particular that only Gaelic-speaking men and Protestants
should be recruited for the ranks.</p>

<p>In spite of his military duties Lord John resided a good deal
in the country&mdash;and not only at the home of his boyhood&mdash;for
early in life he bought Pitnacree in Strathtay, and in later years
he had also a house in Perth. He represented Perthshire in Parliament
from 1734 to 1761. In 1758 he married Miss Dalton of
Bannercross&mdash;a Derbyshire heiress, by whom he had one daughter.
In 1770 he became a full general. His last military achievement
was the raising in 1779 and 1780 (at his own expense) of another
second battalion to the 42nd. This battalion so distinguished itself
in India that in 1786 it was placed permanently on the establishment
under the title of the 73rd Regiment. The veteran to whose
patriotism it owed its existence died on the 26th day of May, 1787,
at the age of seventy-six, the senior officer in the Army.</p>

<p>Lord John made the most of such chances as occurred of
distinguishing himself in the field, but those opportunities were
small for he never served in any war but the Austrian Succession.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
It is therefore as the Colonel of the Black Watch that his name has
survived&mdash;as a man who understood the Highland soldiers well
enough to wish to command them at a time when to many that
might have seemed a task of great difficulty&mdash;and who, having at
last obtained the post he desired, completely identified himself
with the interests of his men, and for upwards of half a century
was the “friend and supporter of every deserving officer and soldier
in the regiment.”</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>John Reid.</em></p>

<p>John Reid was the eldest son of Alexander Robertson of
Straloch, but the head of the family had always been known as
“Baron Reid” and the General and his younger brother, Alexander
(who was an officer in the 42nd), adopted the more distinctive
surname early in life. He was born at Inverchroskie in Strathardle,
on the 13th of February, 1721, and received his early education
at Perth. Being destined for the law, he was afterwards sent to
Edinburgh University. Nature, however, had intended him for a
soldier, and in June, 1745, having recruited the necessary quota
of men, he obtained a commission as lieutenant in Loudon’s
Highlanders. He was taken prisoner at Prestonpans the following
September, but when released the following spring he rejoined his
regiment and was able to render important service to the Government.
From 1747 to 1748 he served in Flanders with Loudon’s
Highlanders and took part in the defence of Bergen-op-Zoom, but
on the reduction of his regiment at the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle he
was placed on half-pay. In 1751 he bought a captain-lieutenant’s
commission in the Black Watch and in 1752 a commission as
captain in the same regiment. Four years later on the outbreak of
the war with France, he sailed with his regiment to America. He
was not present at the first attack on Ticonderoga as he had been
left behind sick at Albany, and his company was commanded in
that desperate engagement by Captain James Murray. In 1759,
Reid, by that time a major, took part in the second advance to
Lake Champlain, which resulted in the surrender of Forts Ticonderoga
and Crown Point; and on him devolved the command of
the 42nd during the greater part of the campaign of 1760 which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
ended with the capture of Montreal and the expulsion of the French
from Canada.</p>

<p>Reid remained in America with the 42nd until Dec., 1761,
when he accompanied it to the West Indies. He served in the
capture of Martinique and at the storming of Morne Tortenson,
on Jan. 24, 1762, was in command of the 1st Battalion of his
regiment. His battalion suffered heavy loss and he was wounded
in two places, but recovered in time to take part in the expedition
against Havana of that same year. After the surrender of Cuba
he returned to America. In 1764 Reid acted as second-in-command
of Colonel Bouquet’s arduous but successful expedition against the
Indians on the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers. In the following year
we hear of him fitting out an expedition which was to be sent to
the Illinois country under the command of Captain Thomas Stirling
of the 42nd.</p>

<p>About 1760, Reid married an American lady of Scots descent,
Susanna Alexander, daughter of James Alexander, surveyor-general
of New York and New Jersey. She owned property on Otter
Creek in what is now the State of Vermont, which was added to
and improved by her husband with the result that at the end of
ten years Reid owned “about thirty-five thousand acres of very
valuable land” near Crown Point and had “obtained from the
Governor and Council of New York a warrant of survey for fifteen
thousand more,” which he intended to “erect” into a manor.</p>

<p>In 1767 the Royal Highland Regiment left America for Ireland
and Reid presumably accompanied it. In 1770 Reid retired on
half-pay, intending no doubt to settle down to the enjoyment and
improvement of his American estates. However, in 1772 his
tenants were expelled by the people of Bennington “on the pretence
of having claim to that country under the Government of New
Hampshire, notwithstanding that the King in Council had, ten
years before, decreed Connecticut River to be the Eastern Boundary
of New York.” In 1775 war broke out with the American colonists,
and though his case finally came before the Commissioners for
American Claims, the only compensation awarded him was a trifling
allowance for mills he had erected and for fees he had paid for
surveys. In May, 1778 his father’s estate, Straloch, passed under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the hammer as he was unable to pay the mortgages and his son
could give him no help.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that he was a comparatively poor man, in
1779-1780 Reid raised at his own expense a regiment of foot, of
which he was appointed colonel. This was called the 95th and was
disbanded in 1783. In 1781 Reid was promoted major-general, and
in 1793 a lieutenant-general. He was appointed colonel of the 88th
Regiment (Connaught Rangers) in November, 1794, and became a
general in 1798. In 1803, when an invasion was hourly expected,
Reid, in response to an order that all general officers not employed
on the staff should transmit their addresses to the Adjutant-General,
wrote that though in the eighty-second years of his age “and
very deaf and infirm,” he was still ready to use his feeble arm in
defence of his country. He died in the Haymarket on the 6th of
February, 1807, and was buried in St. Margaret’s, Westminster.</p>

<p>The General would probably have had but little property to
dispose of at his death, had he not in 1796 succeeded to a valuable
estate of some four or five thousand acres in Nova Scotia, which
was left to him by his cousin, Gen. John Small, “as a mark of ...
respect ... and attachment to the preservation of his name and
representation for succeeding ages.” Reid’s daughter had made a
marriage of which he disapproved, she had no children, and his
only brother had died in 1762 during the siege of Havana. It was
probably these circumstances that induced him to realize the
property in Nova Scotia and at the time of his death he was worth
some £52,000. This entire fortune, went after the death of his
daughter, to the University of Edinburgh to found a musical
professorship. He also left directions that a concert should be given
annually on or about his birthday to commence with several pieces
of his own composition, among the first of which is that of the
“Garb of Old Gaul,” a composition written by Sir Charles Erskine,
but set to music by Reid while major of the 42nd, and which has
<ins class="corr" id="tn-80" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'ever sence'">
ever since</ins> been a regimental march.</p>

<p>Reid also composed several military marches and was esteemed
the best gentleman player on the German flute in England. It may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
safely be predicted that as long as the University exists this old
Perthshire soldier of the 18th century will be remembered as one
of its benefactors.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>John Small.</em></p>

<p>John Small was the third son of Patrick Small, who married
Magdalen Robertson, sister of Alexander Robertson, the father of
General John Reid. Reid and Small were thus not only neighbors
and brother-officers, but first cousins, and were evidently on terms
of close friendship. Born in Strathardle, Atholl, Scotland, in
1730, Small, like many of his countrymen of that date, began his
military career with the Scots Brigade in Holland, being appointed
a 2nd lieutenant in the Earl of Drumlanrig’s Regiment when it was
raised for service of the States-General in 1747. How long he
remained abroad is unknown but it is probable that he returned to
England when the regiment was reduced in 1752. He did not,
however, obtain a commission in the British army until four years
later, when he was appointed lieutenant in the 42nd, just prior to
its departure for America. So far as is known, Small took part
in all the campaigns in which his regiment was engaged from 1756
to 1763. He fought at Ticonderoga in 1758, served with General
Amherst’s successful expedition to Lake Champlain in the following
year, and took part in the operations which completed the conquest
of Canada in 1760. After the surrender of Montreal he was sent
in charge of French prisoners to New York, and we learn from
a brother officer that General Amherst had great confidence in him,
and frequently employed him “on particular services.” Two years
later he served in the capture of Martinique and Havana and
obtained his promotion as captain.</p>

<p>At the peace of 1763 Small was placed on half-pay, but,
according to General Stewart, he was almost immediately put on
the full-pay list of the North British Fusiliers (21st) and when in
1767 the Black Watch left for Europe, most of the men of that
regiment who had volunteered to stay in America joined the Fusiliers
in order to serve under Small, who was “deservedly popular”
with them. Small, however, cannot have served long with the 21st,
for in the same year in which the Black Watch left America he
was appointed “major of brigade” to the forces in North America.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
It was probably during the interval between the Seven Years’ War
and the war with the Americans that he began to acquire the
property in Nova Scotia, part of which he afterwards bequeathed
to his cousin, John Reid. We have some indication that during
this period he interested himself in local politics and formed the
friendship of at least one American which was of value to him later.</p>

<p>Small served throughout the War of Independence though but
rare glimpses are obtained of him. He was present as a brigade-major
at the battle of Bunker Hill, June 17, 1777, and in the course
of that day his life was saved by the American General Putnam,
who, seeing Small standing alone at a time when all around him
had fallen, struck up the barrels of his men’s muskets to save
his life. Shortly after this, Small raised the 2nd battalion of the
Royal Highland Regiment and was appointed major-commandant.
In 1778 the regiment was numbered the 84th and in 1780 he was
promoted to lieutenant-colonel-commandant of his battalion. He is
said to have joined Sir Henry Clinton at New York in 1779, but it
is more probable that he was stationed for the most part in Nova
Scotia. In March, 1783, Small and his battalion were at Fort
Edward, New York, and in the following autumn the battalion was
disbanded at Windsor, Nova Scotia, where many of the men settled
and formed the present town of Douglas.</p>

<p>Small, once more on half-pay, returned home and in 1790 was
promoted colonel and three years later was appointed lieutenant
governor of Guernsey. In October, 1794, he became major-general
and on the 17th of March, 1796, he died in Guernsey and was
buried in the church of St. Peter Port.</p>

<p>General Stewart of Garth wrote of General John Small that
“No chief of former days ever more fairly secured the attachment
of his clan, and no chief, certainly, ever deserved it better. With
an enthusiastic and almost romantic love for his country and countrymen,
it seemed as if the principal object of his life had been to
serve them, and promote prosperity. Equally brave in leading
them in the field, and kind, just, and conciliating in quarters, they
would have indeed been ungrateful if they regarded him otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
than as they did. There was not an instance of desertion in his
battalion.”</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>Thomas Stirling.</em></p>

<p>Thomas Stirling, second son of Sir Henry Stirling, of Ardoch,
was born October 8, 1731. He began his military career in the
Dutch service, being given a commission as ensign in the 1st
Battalion of Col. Marjoribanks’ Regiment on the 30th of September,
1747, and was probably placed on half-pay when the establishment
of the Scots Brigade was reduced in 1752. On the 24th of July,
1757, having been nominated by James, Duke of Atholl, and having
raised the requisite number of men, he was gazetted captain of one
of the three companies added to the 42nd in that year. In
November, 1757, he sailed for America, where he served with his
regiment in the campaigns of the ensuing years, though he was not
present at the first attack on Ticonderoga, owing to the fact that
the new companies had been left behind to garrison Fort Edward.
He took part in the capture of Martinique in 1762 and was wounded
but was able to serve in the capture of Havana later in that year.
He returned with his regiment to America and in August, 1765,
was sent in command of a company to take possession of Fort de
Chartes on the Mississippi. After holding this fort that winter
and spring, he returned with his detachment to the regiment in
June, 1766. The following year the 42nd left America and for
upwards of eight years was quartered in Ireland, after which it was
for a short time in Scotland. In 1770 Stirling was gazetted major
of the regiment, and 1771 lieutenant-Colonel-commandant. Hostilities
broke out with the Americans in 1775, and, Stirling, having
in five months raised the strength of his regiment from 350 men to
1,200, returned with it in the following spring to America, where
he commanded it continuously for three years during the war. He
took part in the engagement at Brooklyn, the attack on Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Washington, the expedition to Pennsylvania, battle of Monmouth,
and others. During 1778-9 he was stationed at or near New York.
In June, 1779, he accompanied a force under General Mathews
through New Jersey in an attempt to rally the supposed loyalists
of that state. This was unsuccessful and ended in the destruction
of the town of Springfield. General Stirling was so severely
wounded while leading the attack that he could take no further
part in the war. His thigh was broken and fearing to be rendered
incapable of further service he refused to have it amputated. He
recovered and was invalided home but he does not appear after this
to have been ever again fit for active duty. In 1782 he was
promoted major-general and appointed colonel of the 71st Foot, but
his regiment was disbanded the following year. His services were
rewarded with a baronetcy and in 1790, he became colonel of the
41st Regiment. In 1796 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and
in 1799 he succeeded his brother in the baronetcy of Ardock. He
attained the rank of general in 1801 and died unmarried on the
9th of May, 1808.</p>

<p class="pfs100">COLONEL ROGER TOWNSHEND.</p>

<p>Roger Townshend, fifth son of Charles Viscount Townshend,
and younger brother of Gen’l George Townshend (afterwards 4th
Viscount and 1st Marquis) to whom Quebec surrendered when
Wolfe was killed, was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel 1st Feb.,
1758, and served as Adjutant-General in the Expedition against
Louisbourg, and Deputy Adjutant-General in this Campaign with
Rank of Colonel. He was killed in the Trenches before Ticonderoga
by a cannon ball on the 25th July, 1759, and his remains
were transmitted to Albany for interment. His spirit and military
knowledge justly entitled him to the esteem of every soldier; and
accordingly the loss of him was universally lamented.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should like to draw your attention to the broken bayonet
in the upper part of the Townshend monument. It is a relic of the
struggle between the French and English in North America and it
comes from Ticonderoga and may have been used in that particular
‘march to Ticonderoga, where Col. Townshend was killed.’ It was
given to Dean Stanley when in America and he fixed it on the
monument as he did the wreath of leaves on the monument of
Major Andre.</p>

<p>Lord Eversley, who when H. M. first Commissioner of Works
was the Rt. Hon. J. G. Shaw Lefevre&mdash;is much struck by the
Townshend inscription, especially the latter part, which, he has told
me, is worthy of Edmund Burke and which I know he would like
to attribute to that great orator and statesman.”</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>TICONDEROGA</em></p>

<p>Ticonderoga, familiar as the name of the historic fortress at
Lake George, was written by Sir William Johnson, in 1756, Tionderogue
and Ticonderoro, and in grant of lands in 1760, “near the
fort at Ticonderoga.” Gov. Colden wrote Ticontarogen, and an
Iroquoian sachem is credited with Decariaderoga. Interpretations
are almost as numerous as orthographies. The most generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
quoted is from Spofford’s Gazetter: “Ticonderoga, from Tsindrosie,
or Cheonderoga, signifying ‘brawling water,’ and the French
name, Carillon, signifying ‘a chime of bells,’ were both suggested
by the rapids upon the outlet of Lake George.” The French name
may have been so suggested, but neither Tsindrosie or Cheonderoga
means “brawling water.” The latter is probably an orthography
of Teonderoga. Ticonderoga as now written, is from Te or Ti,
“dual,” two; Kaniatare, “lake,” and -ogen, “intervallum, divisionem”
(Bruyas), the combination meaning, literally “Between two
lakes.” Horatio Hale wrote me of one of the forms “Dekariaderage,
in <ins class="corr" id="tn-110" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'modern orothography'">
modern orthography</ins>, Tekaniataroken, from which Ticonderoga,
means, simple ‘Between two lakes.’ It is derived from Tioken,
‘between,’ and Kaniatara, ‘lake.’ Its composition illustrates a peculiar
idiom of the Iroquoian language. Tioken when combined with
a noun, is split in two, so to speak, and the noun inserted. Thus in
combining Tioken with Oneonte, ‘mountain,’ we have Ti-ononte-oken,
‘Between two mountains,’ which was the name of one of the
Mohawk castles&mdash;sometimes written Theonondioga. In like manner,
Kaniatare, ‘lake,’ thus compounded, yields Te-kaniatare-oken,
‘Between two lakes.’ In the Huron dialect Kiniatare is contracted
to Yontare or Ontare, from which, with io or iyo, ‘great,’ we get
Ontario (pronounced Ontareeyo), ‘Great lake,’ which combined with
Tioken, becomes Tionteroken, which would seem to be the original
of Colden’s Ticonderoga.”</p>

<p class="pfs100">TESTIMONIALS TO THE BLACK WATCH.</p>

<p>The Virginia Gazette, July 30, 1767, published an article from
which the following extracts have been taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Last Sunday evening, the Royal Highland Regiment embarked
from Philadelphia for Ireland, which regiment, since its arrival
in America, had been distinguished for having undergone most
amazing fatigues, made long and frequent marches through an
unhospitable country, bearing excessive heat and severe cold with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
alacrity and cheerfulness, frequently encamping in deep snow, such
as those who inhabit the interior parts of this province do not see,
and which only those who inhabit the most northern parts of
Europe can have any idea of, continually exposed in camp and on
their marches to the alarms of a savage enemy, who, in all their
attempts, were forced to fly. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> And, in a particular manner,
the free-men of this and the neighboring provinces have most
sincerely to thank them for that resolution and bravery with which
they, under Colonel Boquet, and a small number of Royal Americans,
defeated the enemy, and ensured to us peace and security
from a savage foe; and, along with our blessings for these benefits,
they have our thanks for that decorum in behavior which they
maintained during their stay in this city, giving an example that
the most amiable behavior in civil life is no way inconsistent with
the character of the good soldier; and for their loyalty, fidelity, and
orderly behavior, they have every wish of the people for health,
honor, and a pleasant voyage.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Extract from speech by the elder Pitt in vindication of the
employment of Highland Regiments of which the Black Watch
was the first raised of the eighty-six during the four wars between
1739 and 1815.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sought for merit wherever it was to be found; it is my
boast that I was the first Minister who looked for it and found it
in the mountains of the North. I called it forth and drew into
your service a hardy and intrepid race of men, who, when left by
your jealousy, became a prey to the artifice of your enemies, and
had gone nigh to have overturned the State in the war before the
last. These men in the last war were brought to combat on your
side, they served with fidelity as they fought with valour, and
conquered for you in every part of the world.”</p>

<p class="pfs100">THE BLACK WATCH MEMORIAL AT TICONDEROGA.</p>

<p>The genesis of this memorial was an address made by the late
Joseph Cook at the services held in front of the boulder erected to
the heroes of Ticonderoga, Academy Park, Ticonderoga, N. Y.
July 31, 1899, in which he made this remark: “There ought to be
a memorial to the Black Watch composed largely of Scotch Highlanders
who, with the Colonials charged Montcalm’s entrenchments
for eight consecutive hours.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp55" id="i114" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The writer, who was secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical
Society at that time, had the honor of being the medium through
which this chance remark became an enduring memorial of brick
and stone. He was unsuccessful, however, until Mr. David
Williams, the publisher of “The Iron Age,” a summer resident of
Ticonderoga at Rogers Rock, came to his assistance. Mr. Andrew
Carnegie was the generous donor of the funds to build this memorial.
The grants were in two amounts, the first gift for a public
library with the usual provisions, and the second gift, with no
limitations, with which to build an historical addition to the library,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-115" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'thus makng it'">
thus making it</ins> both a public library and historical building.</p>

<p>The laying of the corner stone, Oct. 4. 1905, was made the
occasion for one of the greatest celebrations Ticonderoga has ever
seen. The pipe band of the 5th Royal Scots of Canada, Highlanders,
now the 5th Royal Highlanders of Canada, from Montreal,
and the Regimental band and a Battalion of the 5th Infantry,
U. S. A., from Plattsburgh, were the principal features of the
parade. It was particularly appropriate that the Royal Scots
should be present, as they are allied to the Black Watch and wear
the same uniform. It was also an education to the thousands of
spectators, few, if any of whom had ever seen Highlanders in full
regimentals marching to the music of bagpipes. After the exercises
of the day, the Royal Scots visited the ruins of old Fort
Ticonderoga, about two miles from the village and the picture of a
body of Highlanders with their scarlet coats and tartan kilts
marching up the green slopes of the old ramparts, with the setting
sun behind them, was one never to be forgotten and which probably
had not occurred since the Revolution.</p>

<p>The officers of the present Black Watch Regiment, then stationed
at Fort George Scotland, being advised of the Memorial sent
the following letter to the secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical
Society:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Sir: Your letter 9th Sept., 1905, on the subject of a
Black Watch Memorial, has been perused by the Commanding
Officer and the Officers of the 1st battalion of The Black Watch,
formerly called the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment, and it was also
submitted and discussed at the Annual Gathering of Black Watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Officers&mdash;past and present&mdash;recently held in Edinburgh. I am
authorized to inform you that all Ranks of the Regiment are proud
to know that the Ticonderoga Historical Society had decided to
appropriate an alcove in the Ticonderoga Free Public Library as a
memorial to the 42nd Regiment, to commemorate their services in
the engagement before Fort Ticonderoga on July 8, 1758. The
suggestion contained in your letter, to the effect that Officers of
the Regiment might be disposed to erect a tablet on a wall of the
Alcove to the memory of the officers and men of the 42nd who were
killed or wounded in the action has met with the unanimous
approval of those to whose notice it has been brought, and I am to
inform you that such a Tablet will gladly be provided and that the
work of executing the Tablet will be entrusted to a London firm
as soon as a suitable design has been decided upon. In order to
assist us in choosing a suitable form of tablet I shall be much
obliged if you can favor me with a rough plan of the alcove, the
dimensions of the actual wall on which the Tablet will rest, and an
idea of the general style of the building.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as you can conveniently
supply the information for which I have asked.</p>

<p class="right padr6">I am, Sir, yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">D. L. Wilson Farquharson.</span><br />
Major The Black Watch.”</p>
</div>

<p>The exercises for the unveiling of the memorial tablet July 4,
1906, was made the occasion for another grand celebration at which
the full bag pipe band of the 5th Royal Highlanders of Canada
and a company of 50 men from the same regiment, making a total
of 75 Highlanders, were a feature of the parade. Major D. L.
Wilson Farquharson of the Black Watch, came over from Scotland
to unveil the tablet in behalf of the Regiment. It was accepted by
Frank B. Wickes of Ticonderoga for the Ticonderoga Historical
Society. The address of the day was delivered by Senator Edgar
T. Brackett of Saratoga Springs.</p>

Capt. Campbell are interesting because they illustrate the Scottish custom
of using name of estate rather than the family or given name. This was
often necessary to distinguish between several of same name.</p>

<p>Captain Stratchur is Captain John Campbell of Stratchur, there are
also John Campbells of Duneavis, and of Glendaruel. Archie Sherreff is
Lieut. Archibald Campbell, son of the Sheriff of Argyle. Duchra is Capt.
Thomas Graeme of Duchray. George and “the Major” are sons of John
Campbell of Barcaldine&mdash;George Campbell was appointed Ensign in the
42d in 1756, promoted Lieut, in Gage’s Regiment 1757, and killed at Havana
1762. “The Major” was Alexander Campbell, Major in the 77th (Montgomery
Highlanders). Unkle Corries is John Campbell of Corries and his son
Colin was evidently at the massacre at Fort William Henry in August
1757. Fort du Quesne was the French fort at what is now Pittsburgh.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Missing anchor for Footnote [23] was inserted after ‘Allan Campbell.’
on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>. Missing anchor for Footnote [29] was inserted after
‘soon thereafter.’ on <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>.</p>

<p>Nine paragraph breaks were introduced to better indicate a quotation
block, for example after ‘Lossing writes,’ on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>.</p>

<p>The original blank cells in the table in <a href="#App_F">Appendix F</a> have been given a dash (-)
in this etext for clarity.</p>

<p>In <a href="#App_P">Appendix P</a> information about the ‘2nd Batt.’ of a regiment was
sometimes on a separate line. For consistency all regimental info is
in one paragraph in this etext.</p>

<p>The original text used three asterisks <span class="nowrap">(* * *)</span> to indicate missing
or skipped words, but sometimes used two or four or five. For consistency
the etext always uses three. On <a href="#Page_80">page 80</a> an ellipsis is used (twice) instead
of asterisks in both the original and the etext.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
