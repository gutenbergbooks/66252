THE BLACK WATCH AT TICONDEROGA

BY FREDERICK B. RICHARDS, A. M., Glens Falls, N. Y.


A residence of ten years in Ticonderoga inspired me with an
appreciation of the history of that most historic spot in America,
and when as secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical Society I was
instrumental in securing the erection of the Black Watch Memorial
in that village, I became particularly interested in the record of
that famous Highland Regiment which this building commemorates.

It has for several years been my wish to write so complete an
account of the Black Watch at Ticonderoga that one would need look
in no other place for any detail in the history of that regiment
from the time it left Scotland in 1756 until after the capture of
Ticonderoga by Amherst in 1759. As a meeting of the New York State
Historical Association on Lake Champlain seemed an appropriate time
to present such a paper and the printed histories of that period
give only meagre accounts on this subject, Mrs. Richards and I made
this an excuse for a trip to the British Isles and a large part of
August and September, 1910, was spent on a Black Watch pilgrimage.
We had a very enjoyable trip and gained many interesting facts but
I am sorry to say that the story is still far from complete.

The reason for the lack of more detailed information about the
Regiment in the Ticonderoga period is found in the following which
is copied from the preface of Stewart of Garth’s first edition:

  “The origin of these Sketches and Military Details was simply
  this: When the Forty-second regiment was removed from Dublin
  to Donaghadee in the year 1771, the baggage was sent round by
  sea. The vessel having it on board was unfortunately driven on
  shore by a gale of wind, and wrecked; the greater part of the
  cargo and baggage was lost, and the portion saved, especially
  the regimental books and records, was much injured. A misfortune
  somewhat similar occurred, when the army, under the Earl of
  Moira, landed at Ostend in June, 1794. The transports were
  ordered round to Helvoetsluys, with orders to wait the further
  movements of the troops. But the vessels had not been long there,
  when the enemy invaded Holland in great force, and, entering
  Helvoetsluys, seized on the transports in the harbour. Among
  the number of vessels taken were those which had conveyed the
  Forty-second to Flanders, having on board every article of
  regimental baggage, except the knapsacks with which the officers
  and soldiers had landed at Ostend in light marching order. Along
  with the baggage, a well-selected library, and, what was more to
  be regretted, all that remained of the historical records of the
  regiment, from the period of its formation till the year 1793,
  fell into the hands of the enemy.

  “After the conclusion of the late war, his Royal Highness, the
  Commander-in-Chief, directed that the Forty-second should draw up
  a record of its services and enter it in the regimental books,
  for the information of those who should afterwards belong to
  the corps. As none of the officers who had served previously to
  the loss of the records in 1794 were then in the regiment, some
  difficulty arose in drawing up the required statement of service;
  indeed, to do so correctly was found impossible, as, for a period
  of fifty-four years previous to 1793, the materials were very
  defective. In this situation, the commanding officer, in the
  year 1817, requested me to supply him with a few notices on the
  subject.”

It seemed to have been the custom in the British army of that
period for a Regiment to carry its entire belongings with it
from place to place and this unfortunate practice has swept from
existence every trace of the Regimental records of the Black Watch
of Ticonderoga.

It may be readily seen that if Colonel Stewart who had all the
information in 1817 which the British government was able to supply
and who was also fortunate in having had an intimate acquaintance
during his service in the Regiment with officers who have served
almost from its formation, was unable to write a complete record,
the task nearly one hundred years later might be considered well
nigh hopeless. There was the hope, however, that some record which
was then lost might have been discovered since Colonel Stewart’s
time or that interesting matter might be found in the archives of
the families who had sons in the Black Watch of 1758. It is a fact
that only recently the regimental records of the Black Watch of
two decades later were found in an old second-hand book store in
Portsmouth and it is still possible that the regimental records of
1758-9, which are now lost, may yet come to light.

We find that nearly all the histories of the Highland Regiments
follow Stewart of Garth nearly word for word in their accounts of
the early history of the Black Watch. A notable exception, however,
is “A Military History of Perthshire,” which has much that is new.
There are also many interesting letters and other records in “The
Chronicles of the Atholl and Tullibardine Families,” relating to
the service of those of the Black Watch who came from the Atholl
Family or estate, and at London we found some dispatches in the
Public Record Office in the War Department which I have not seen
published. The chief merit, however, if any, which I can claim
for this address is that while it does not add much that is new,
it does, I think, collect in one article nearly all that is known
about the Black Watch of the Ticonderoga period.

I might say here, also, that whatever was lacking in information
was more than made up by the cordiality of our reception, as we
found nearly every Scotsman interested in the oldest Highland
Regiment of the British Army and glad to help us in any way
possible. We are under special obligation, which I here wish to
acknowledge, to Lt. Col. Hugh Rose, the present commander of the
First Battalion of the Black Watch; Major D. L. Wilson Farquharson,
D. S. O., who represented the Regiment at the unveiling of the
memorial tablet at Ticonderoga, July 4, 1906, now retired and
living in Allargue in Aberdeenshire, the home of the Farquharson’s
for many generations; W. Skeoch Cumming of Edinburgh, artist and
authority on Scottish costumes and tartans of the 18th century;
Mrs. Campbell of Dunstaffnage, present owner of old Inverawe House;
the Marchioness of Tullibardine, editor of “A Military History
of Perthshire,” and the Duke of Atholl, present head of the Clan
Murray, Honorary Colonel of the Third Battalion of the Black Watch
and compiler of the “Chronicles of the Atholl and Tullibardine
Families.”

Before proceeding to the Black Watch of Ticonderoga, it would
perhaps be well to give a brief history of the Regiment. There is
considerable difference of opinion as to just when the independent
companies which were afterwards to become the present regiment of
the line were raised. The earliest record I have seen is that on
the 3rd of August, 1667, King Charles II issued a commission under
the Great Seal to John, second Earl of Atholl “to raise and keep
such a number of men as he should think fit to be a constant guard
for securing the peace in the Highlands” and “to watch upon the
braes.”[1]

From this time until 1739 the Black Watch was in various stages of
formation.[2]

It was at the period of the independent companies that the name
Black Watch was given--Black from the sombre tartan in contrast to
the regular soldiers who at that time had coats, waistcoats and
breeches of scarlet cloth, and Watch because their duties were to
watch or keep order in the Highlands. The character of the rank and
file of the Black Watch of this period was exceedingly high, many
gentlemen with servants serving as privates, and in addition to the
enlistment being from the best families it was also possible to
select only “men of full height, well proportioned and of handsome
appearance.” There were several reasons for this, the principal one
being probably the fact that at that period the carrying of arms
was prohibited by penalties and it became an “object of ambition
with all the young men of spirit to be admitted even as privates
into a service which gave them the privilege of wearing arms.”
Our interest in the Black Watch, however, is principally in the
Regiment of the line as such and this dates from the commission
given by George II, October 25, 1739, as follows:

  “GEORGE R.--Whereas we have thought fit, that a regiment of
  foot be forthwith formed under your command, and to consist of
  ten companies, each to contain one captain, one lieutenant, one
  ensign, three serjeants, three corporals, two drummers, and one
  hundred effective private men; which said regiment shall be
  partly formed out of six Independent Companies of Foot in the
  Highlands of North Britain, three of which are now commanded by
  captains, and three by captain-lieutenants. Our will and pleasure
  therefore is, that one serjeant, one corporal, and fifty private
  men, be forthwith taken out of the three companies commanded
  by captains, and ten private men from the three commanded by
  captain-lieutenants, making one hundred and eighty men, who are
  to be equally distributed into the four companies hereby to be
  raised; and the three serjeants and three corporals, draughted
  as aforesaid, to be placed to such of the four companies as you
  shall judge proper; and the remainder of the non-commissioned
  officers and private men, wanting to complete them to the above
  number, to be raised in the Highlands with all possible speed;
  the men to be natives of that country, and none other to be taken.

  This regiment shall commence and take place according to the
  establishment thereof. And of these our orders and commands, you,
  and the said three captains, and the three captain-lieutenants
  commanding at present the six Independent Highland Companies, and
  all others concerned, are to take notice, and to yield obedience
  thereunto accordingly.

  Given at our Court at St. James’s, this 25th day of October,
  1739, and in the 13th year of our reign.

      By His Majesty’s Command,
      (Signed): Wm. Yonge.

  To our Right Trusty and Right Well-Beloved
  Cousin, John Earl of
  Craufurd and Lindsay.”

The tallest men of the Regiment of that period were formed into a
Grenadier Company and wore the Grenadier bearskin. The rest of the
uniform as above and the substitution of the blue bonnet for the
bearskin was the uniform for the rest of the Regiment.]

May, 1740, these ten companies were mustered in a field between
Taybridge and Aberfeldy and in the army list of that year were
known as “Earl of Crawford’s Regiment of Foot in the Highlands.”[3]
There have been several changes of the official name of the
Regiment but the “Black Watch” was always the familiar one in the
country where it has drawn its recruits and since 1881 has been the
official name in the British Army List.[4]

  The uniform of this period was a “scarlet jacket and waistcoat,
  with buff facings and white lace, tartan plaid of twelve yards
  plaited round the middle of the body, the upper part being fixed
  on the left shoulder, ready to be thrown loose and wrapped over
  both shoulders and firelock in rainy weather. At night, the plaid
  served the purpose of a blanket, and was a sufficient covering
  for the Highlanders. These were called belted plaids, from being
  kept tight to the body by a belt, and were worn on guards,
  reviews, and on all occasions when the men were in full dress. On
  this belt hung the pistols and dirk when worn. In the barracks,
  and when not on duty, the little kilt or philibeg was worn, a
  blue bonnet with a border of white, red, and green, arranged
  in small squares to resemble, as is said, the fess cheque in
  the arms of the different branches of the Stewart family, and
  a tuft of feathers, or sometimes, from economy or necessity, a
  small piece of black bearskin. The arms were a musket, a bayonet,
  and a large basket-hilted broadsword. These were furnished by
  Government; such of the men as chose to supply themselves with
  pistols and dirks were allowed to carry them, and targets after
  the fashion of the country. The sword-belt was of black leather,
  and the cartouch-box was carried in front, supported by a narrow
  belt round the middle.”[5]

  “While the companies acted independently, each commander assumed
  the tartan of his own Clan. When embodied, no clan having a
  superior claim to offer an uniform plaid to the whole, and Lord
  Crawford, the colonel, being a Lowlander, a new pattern was
  assumed, and which has ever since been known as the 42d, or Black
  Watch tartan, being distinct from all others.[6] Lord John Murray
  gave the Athole tartan for the philibeg. The difference was only
  a stripe of scarlet, to distinguish it from that of the belted
  plaid. The pipers wore a red tartan of very bright colours, (of
  the pattern known by the name of the Stewart or Royal Tartan), so
  that they could be more clearly seen at a distance. When a band
  of music was added, plaids of the pipers’ pattern were given to
  them.”[7]

Having given briefly the origin of the Regiment, we will pass to
the period which is the subject of our article.

May, 1756, war having been formally declared between France and
England, a body of troops, the Highlanders forming a part, were
embarked under the command of Lieut. General James Abercrombie
and landed at New York, June, 1756. These were soon followed
by more troops under the Earl of Loudon who was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Army of America.

The official name of the Regiment at this time was the 42d Regiment
of Foot, but they are often spoken of in dispatches simply as the
Highlanders, because they were the only Highland Regiment then
in this section, or as Lord John Murray’s Highlanders from the
custom of the times of calling a Regiment by the name of its
Honorary Colonel. The commander of the Black Watch at this time
was Lieut. Col. Francis Grant, son of the Laird of Grant, who had
served in the Regiment from the time he had received his commission
as Ensign, October 25, 1739. He was made Lieutenant Colonel
December 17, 1755 and was in command of the Regiment all through
the American campaign. The only other officer who had served
continuously from the formation of the Regiment in 1739 was Gordon
Graham of Drainie, who in 1756 was senior captain.

The record of the Regiment from the landing in June, 1756, until
the battle of July, 1758, is exceedingly meagre. In fact nothing
of importance was done by the whole army. As one author puts it
“Loudon was so engrossed in schemes for improving the condition of
his men that he seemed to have no time for employing them against
the enemy.” The following extract from a letter from the Earl of
Loudon to William Pitt dated New York, March 10th, 1757, will
illustrate the method of quartering troops of that period.

  “In the end of your letter you have acquainted me, that words
  shall be inserted, in the mutiny act to take away every doubt
  about the Right of Quartering extending to America.

  When I writ on that subject, I was but just arrived, and the
  troops were mostly encamped. Since that I have had disputes to
  settle, all over this Continent, in settling the winter quarters
  for the Troops from whence I find, that the manner of quartering
  in England, as in time of peace, on Publick Houses only, will in
  no shape answer the intent in this country, for there are few
  Publick Houses and most of them sell nothing but spirits, where
  they possess only one room in which they sell the liquor, where
  men cannot be quartered.

  Whilst the war lasts, necessity will justify exceeding that
  rule, as Troops must be under cover, in the places where it is
  necessary to post them, for the security of the country and
  carrying on the service, but as soon as a peace comes, it will,
  by the English rule, be impossible to quarter any number of
  Troops, in this country, without a new regulation, and the only
  remedy that occurs to me at present, is adopting the method of
  quartering in Scotland, where for the same reason of there not
  being Publick Houses sufficient for the reception of Troops they
  are by law quartered on private houses.

  I must beg leave to give you one instance of the situation of
  quarters here. When I arrived at Albany, I do not believe it
  was possible to have quartered Fifty men on that town, on all
  the Publick Houses in it, and taking a full survey of it, I
  found that by quartering on the Private Houses, I can, without
  incommoding them, in the parts of their houses, in which they
  live, quarter Fourteen Hundred men, and for a short time, in case
  of necessity, I could quarter Two thousand. I have mentioned this
  to show you what the situation of all the Frontier Places, in
  this country that are liable to attacks, must be, if quartering
  is likely to be kept to, on Publick Houses only.

  On the 10th instant arrived the Harriet Packet which brought me
  the duplicates of your letters of the 9th and 11th of January,
  and the next day came in here His Majesty’s ship the Hampshire
  commanded by Captain Norbury, having under his convoy the nine
  additional companies of the Highlanders,[8] who had a passage
  of twelve weeks from Cork, and met with very bad weather; of
  this convoy there were missing on his arrival in this Port,
  the Arundal and Salisbury Transports. The last we have, since,
  accounts of her getting into Rhode Island.

  The Troops being sickly, I have cantooned them in villages
  adjacent to this Port, for the sake of fresh provisions and
  vegetables.”

In the published histories of the time it is stated that the

  “42d remained inactive in or near Albany during 1756 and that
  throughout the winter and spring of the following year the men
  were drilled and disciplined for bush fighting and markmanship, a
  species of warfare for which they were well fitted, being for the
  most part good shots and experts in the management of arms.”

From the following letters found in the Public Record Office in
London the quarters for the winter of 1756-7 were probably at
Schenectady. Extract from letter from Loudon to Pitt, New York,
25th April, 1757,

  “The Highlanders were set in motion from Schenectady * * * they
  marched without tents and lay in the woods upon the snow making
  great fires and I do not find the troops have suffered * * * We
  have on that River (Mohawk) at Schenectady and up to the German
  Flats, the Highland Regiment upwards of a thousand men,” etc.

The second letter reads as follows, and while it is chiefly of
interest in this connection because it is dated from Schenectady,
it also illustrates the custom of selling commissions:

        Schenectady, April 24, 1757.

  Francis Grant, Lt. Col. 42d Regiment.

  Sir:--

  I am convinced from several things that have happened me since I
  have been in the Regiment that my continuing to serve any longer
  in it would be disagreeable to the whole corps of officers and
  being likewise sensible of my own unfitness for a military life
  I have resolved to quit the Army as soon as I can obtain leave
  to resign my commission. But as I have nothing else in the world
  to depend upon and finding myself at present at a distance from
  my family and friends or anyone whom I can depend on for advice,
  interest or assistance and having frequently experienced your
  goodness and favor, I have made bold to apply to you that you
  would be pleased to intercede with his Excellency the Earl of
  Loudon, in my behalf that His Lordship in consideration of my
  distressed situation and circumstances might be moved to give me
  leave to resign in favor of some person that would be willing to
  allow me wherewithal to support me till I can settle and apply to
  some other way of life.

      In doing me this favor you’ll forever oblige, Sir,
      Your respectful and gratefully obed’t hum. serv’t,
          George Maclagan, Ens.

  P. S.--If it is agreeable to your Lordship I am willing to pay
  fifty pound Sterling for Mr. Peter Grant Voluntier.

      Francis Grant, Lt. Col. 42d. Regt.”

With these two dispatches from the British War Office as a clew I
have tried to learn more about the winter quarters of the Black
Watch and have looked through the Colonial manuscript in the New
York State Library,[9] the Records of the City of Albany and the
published works of the period but so far without success. I have
been unable to find any Schenectady records of this period. It
seems that a valuable collection of Glen-Sanders papers from the
old Mansion across the Mohawk from Schenectady was recently sold
and I have been told that in these there were several references
to officers of the Black Watch. As the Glens[10] were Scots
it would be quite likely that if this collection were not now
scattered to the four winds much information about the Highlanders
could be obtained. It is said that Schenectady was only a frontier
village in 1756 and not large enough to take care of a regiment
and it seems to be a fact from the reference given above that only
a part of the thousand men were stationed here as it states that
the Regiment was stretched along the Mohawk from Schenectady to
the German Flats, but that it was a station for troops is proven
by the list in the Public Record Office of the winter quarters for
the troops in America for 1758, which states that the Black Watch
was quartered in New York and Lt. General Murray’s at Schenectady.
There is in the Public Record Office no list of winter quarters of
the troops in America previous to 1758.[11]

It appears, however, from the Town Records of Stamford, Conn.,
that a committee representing that town made a claim on the
“General Court” of the Colony of Connecticut to reimburse them
for £369-13-4½ which the town had expended “in taking care of
the Highlanders from November 30, 1757, to March 30, 1758. The
soldiers numbered 250 officers and men and they had also belonging
to them 17 women and 9 children.” They were probably part of the
Black Watch. The only other Highland regiments of that time were
Montgomery’s and Fraser’s, both raised in 1757 and their arrival
at New York from Halifax is noted in the “Post Boy” of April 11,
1757. This town record also further illustrates the custom of that
time as previously stated and as an officer of the present Regiment
aptly puts it, “they took not only their mess plate but their wives
also, on service with them, and sometimes lost both.”

This 250 at Stamford would only be a quarter of the Regiment,
however, if Loudon had upwards of a thousand at or near Schenectady
the winter before and it is probable that the rest were quartered
at or near Schenectady as in 1756.

Another statement that I have tried to confirm is the account by
James Grant in his “Legends of the Black Watch” of the 50 chosen
men under orders of MacGillivray of Glen Arrow, who went to
reinforce Col. Munro at Fort William Henry. It is also said in a
foot note of Wilson’s Orderly Book that Capt. Gordon Graham was
at Fort William Henry at the time of the surrender, and this is
repeated in N. Y. Colonial Mss. by O’Callaghan, page 728, Vol. 10,
but I have not been able to find any other reference that would
substantiate these statements.

The only time the 42d emerges from the haze of mystery from June,
1756, to the spring of 1758, is that they were a part of Loudon’s
expedition against Louisbourg in 1757, and this was more a summer
vacation than an act of war.

If the English could have attacked Louisbourg in the spring
or early summer, success would have been certain but Loudon
couldn’t seem to get started. As a messenger from the Governor of
Pennsylvania, who had waited in vain for a reply to a message,
said about him he was like “St. George on a tavern sign, always on
horse back and never riding on.” The expedition did not start from
New York until June 20th and entered Halifax harbor the 30th. Even
after this delay he was there before Admiral Holbourne, who did not
arrive from England with his fleet of 15 ships-of-the-line and 3
frigates, with 5,000 troops until July 10th. Then there was more
delay, the 12,000 troops were landed and weeks spent in drilling
and planting vegetables for their refreshment. Lord Charles Hay was
put under arrest for saying that the “nation’s money was spent in
sham battles and raising cabbages.” The troops were embarked again,
but Aug. 4th a sloop came from Newfoundland bringing news of the
arrival of three French squadrons at Louisbourg and as an attack
after this reinforcement would be hopeless, the costly enterprise
was abandoned and Loudon and the troops sailed back to New York
where he arrived Aug. 31st. Delay was the ruin of the Louisbourg
expedition and drew off British forces from the frontier where they
were most needed.

The troops were started immediately up the Hudson as soon as
they were landed at New York but Fort William Henry had already
been captured Aug. 9th and the French forces had fallen back to
Ticonderoga.

The spring of 1758 opened up with bright prospects. Lord Loudon had
been recalled and General Abercrombie, with the able assistance
of Lord Howe, was in command. Admiral Boscowen was appointed to
command the fleet and Major-General Amherst and Brigadier-Generals
Wolfe, Townsend and Murray were added to the military staff. Three
expeditions were proposed for this year, Louisbourg, Ticonderoga
and Crown Point, and Fort DuQuesne. The army in America had
been largely reinforced during the winter and spring. Of these
reinforcements the 42d was strengthened by three additional
companies and recruits bringing the Regiment up to about 1,300 men.

As we have considerable information about these three companies
through the Atholl Records, it will be interesting to turn back
and follow them from the start to the beginning of the Ticonderoga
campaign. The first item and one of interest because it shows
the method of raising companies in those days, is a letter from
the Duke of Argyll to the Duke of Atholl, dated London, July 9,
1757.[12]

  “My Lord:--This is to acquaint your Grace that there is to be
  3 additional Companies raised for Lord John Murray’s Regiment.
  I believe the nomination of the officers will be left to me
  and consequently to Your Grace; there will be 3 captains, 6
  lieutenants and 3 ensigns and 100 men each company. The raising
  the men will be the merit of those who shall desire to be
  officers and if any can be found who have served in Holland, so
  much the better. Your Grace will have your thought on this but
  don’t promise anybody till you let me hear from you. I shall
  speak to Lord John but I will bid him consult you and will
  plainly tell him that the commissions must all be given gratis.
  The other two Highland Regiments will likewise have the same
  addition made to them.

  I am with the greatest truth and respect, My Lord, Yr Gr’s most
  faithful and obt. h’ble Servant, Argyll.”

By the Duke of Atholl’s recommendation the three companies were
given to James Stewart of Urrard; James Murray, nephew of the Duke
of Atholl and son of Lord George Murray; and Thomas Stirling of
Ardoch. Three of the new subalterns were from the Atholl estate,
namely Lieut. Alexander Menzies and Ensigns Duncan Stewart, son
of Derculich, and George Rattray, son of Dalralzion. The three
companies were mustered in October and marched from Perth to
Glasgow, where they remained until November 15, when they marched
to Greenock and embarked December 1st in transports for Cork en
route to America.

April 22, 1758, Capt. James Murray wrote from New York to Mr.
Murray of Strowan announcing his safe arrival after a voyage
of eleven weeks from Cork. The joys of a voyage in those times
when it could take ten days to sail from Scotland to Ireland, is
illustrated by a letter from Capt. Murray, dated Youghall, 11 Dec.,
1757.[13]

  My dear Brother:--This is to let you know that I am just now
  in good health and safely arrived here with my company. My
  transport, together with the other five, set sail on the 1st
  cur’t in the evening along with the Convoy; we had a fair wind
  and good weather until Sunday, early in the morning (when we
  were past Waterfort in our way to Corck) about eight, there came
  on one of the most prodigeous storms that the sailors said they
  had never seen the like before. About two in the afternoon we
  lost sight of the Convoy and all the transports and have not yet
  any sure accounts whether they have got all safe into harbours
  or not. But since I came here I hear that there was five or six
  ships lost on the Coast that day. The storm abated somewhat
  Monday morning but it continued bad weather until Friday evening,
  during which time we were often in risk of our lives especially
  twice, once being within two yards of a great rock and the other
  time when we were on two fathom water going on a sandbank.

  During all that time we were near several harbours, such as
  Doublin, Waterfort, Corck and others but all without success.
  Saturday and this day we had good weather by which means we got
  into harbour.

      Your most aff’te brother,
      James Murray.


From November until April seems a long voyage from Scotland to
America even in those days of primitive navigation, but another of
the three additional companies was blown into Antigua and did not
arrive at New York until June.

With the activities of the preparations for the Ticonderoga
campaign a number of dispatches were sent to the Home Government
and it is possible to follow more closely the fortunes of the Black
Watch.

The addition of these three companies raised the Regiment to 1,300
men, and we find among the official documents a petition from Capt.
Gordon Graham, endorsed by Lt. Col. Grant and General Abercrombie,
asking to be made Major in addition to Major Duncan Campbell, as
follows:[14]

  To His Excellency James Abercromby, Esq., General and Commander
  in Chief of all His Majesty’s forces in North America, etc.,
  etc., etc.

  The Memorial of Gordon Graham, eldest Captain in His Majesty’s
  42nd Regiment of Foot in North America.

  Humbly sheweth

  That your memorialist hath had the honour to serve His Majesty
  upwards of twenty-five years, twelve of which as Captain in the
  above Regiment and is now eldest in that Rank.

  That he hath served in Flanders and elsewhere during all the last
  war, some part of which he was employed as Major of Brigade,
  and had a commission as such from General St. Clair, on the
  expedition under his command in the year 1746.

  May it therefore please your Excellency to lay his case before
  His Majesty that he in his great wisdom may be graciously pleased
  to promote him to the Rank of Major when an opportunity offers,
  all which is humbly submitted.

  To His Excellency, James Abercromby, Esqr., General and Commander
  in Chief of all his Majesty’s forces in North America, etc.,
  etc., etc.

  The Memorial of Colonel Francis Grant, Commanding his Majesty’s
  42nd Regiment of Foot.

  Humbly sheweth

  That his Majesty having thought proper to augment the said
  Regiment to 1,300 men by adding three additional companies to it,
  and such a body of men being too numerous to be exercised and
  disciplined by one Major only, your memorialist humbly conceives,
  that it would be for the good of his Majesty’s service to have
  another Major added, as has been already done to the other two
  Highland Battalions commanded by the Colonels Montgomery and
  Fraser.

  May it therefore please your Excellency to lay this matter before
  His Majesty that he in his great wisdom may be graciously pleased
  to give such directions thereupon as shall be thought necessary,
  all which is humbly submitted.

  Colo. Grant, commanding His Majesty’s 42nd Regiment, and Mr.
  Gordon Graham, a Captain in the same, having each of them
  presented me with a memorial, the contents of which I know to
  be true, I herewith transmit them to your Lordship, to be laid
  before the King, and to know His Royal Pleasure therein.

Extract from a letter signed James Abercromby to the Right Hon.
Lord Viscount Barrington, dated New York, Apr. 28, 1758.

As will be seen later Capt. Graham became Major before hearing from
the King.

The next dispatch which is of interest and which makes changes
in the list of Commissioned Officers is as follows: Extract from
letter signed by James Abercromby to the Right Honorable the Lord
Viscount Barrington, dated Albany, May 27, 1758.[15]

  “In the list of the Commissions which I had the honour to
  transmit to your Lordship, by my last letter, you will have
  observed two vacancies in the 42nd Regiment, occasioned by the
  removal of Sir James Cockburn into the 48th which could not be
  filled up at the time my letter went away, as the gentlemen,
  whom it was proposed should purchase those vacancies were
  then at Albany,[16] and their answer not arrived; since that
  the Lieutenancy has been made out in the name of Mr. Patrick
  Balnevas, and bears date the 1st of April; and Mr. Elbert Hering
  succeeds to the Ensigncy, dated the 3rd of the same month.”

Then we have the dispatch just before the battle from Abercrombie
to Pitt, dated Camp at Lake George, June 29, 1758, saying:

  “Arrived Fort Edward on the 9th, where Lord Howe was encamped
  with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th Regiments and 4 companies of
  Rangers. Remainder of Regulars were at posts below on Hudson
  River and were working up the stores, etc. On the 17th Lord Howe
  marched to the Brook, half way between Fort Edward and the Lake
  with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th. This Half-way Brook was judged a
  proper post for the first Deposit in a Portage of 15 miles.[17]
  After the carriages had made several trips Lord Howe advanced to
  the Lake with the 42nd, 44th, and 55th.”

Attached to this letter is a report of troops at Lake George, June
29, 1758, and the roll of the 42nd was as follows:

  “10 companies, 1 Lt. Colonel, 1 Major, 8 Captains, 18
  Lieutenants, 7 Ensigns, 1 Chaplain, 1 Adjutant, 1 QuarterMaster,
  1 Surgeon, 2 Mates, 40 Sergeants, 18 Drummers; Rank and File--981
  fit for duty, 11 sick present, 6 in general hospital, 2 on
  command, 1,000 total. 1 drummer and 40 rank and file wanting to
  complete.”

We find the solution of why there were only 1,000 of the Black
Watch with the Ticonderoga expedition when its strength was known
to be 1,300 at that time, in another extract of the Report of
June 29th from Abercrombie to Pitt: “I have left two additional
Companies of Lord John Murray’s to garrison Fort Edward. The
other additional company of the 42nd which was blown into Antego
(Antigua), I hear is arrived at New York, which I have ordered up
to Albany.”

This is confirmed in more detail in a letter from Sir Robert
Menzies to Mr. Murray of Strowan, dated Rannock, 6th Sept., 1758,
in which is an extract from a letter received by Menzies from
“Jamie Stewart.”[18]

  “That, after the additional Companies arrived in Fort Edward, the
  best men were picked out to compleat the Regiment in place of the
  sick and old men that were put in their place. That, as Capt.
  Reid was left behind sick at Albany, Capt. Murray was appointed
  to his company and Reid to the additionals, as Capt. Abercrombie
  was to Capt. Murray’s Company. That the additional companies,
  with Captains Sterling, Reid, and Abercrombie, etc., were left
  at Fort Edward, where they had nothing to do but to garrison the
  Fort and divert themselves.”

Everything is now in readiness for the attack on Ticonderoga and
an army of six thousand three hundred seventy-seven regulars and
nine thousand thirty-four provincials (Abercrombie to Pitt July 12,
1758) embarked at Lake George early on the morning of July 5th.
There were nine hundred batteaux, a hundred and thirty-five whale
boats and a large number of heavy flatboats carrying the artillery
and from front to rear the line was six miles long.

The Embarkation of Abercrombie’s Army at Lake George, July 5,
1758]

Parkman in his “Montcalm and Wolfe” paints the scene as follows:

  “The spectacle was superb; the brightness of the summer day;
  the romantic beauty of the scenery; the sheen and sparkle of
  those crystal waters; the countless islets, tufted with pine,
  birch, and fir; the bordering mountains, with their green summits
  and sunny crags; the flash of oars and glitter of weapons; the
  banners, the varied uniforms, and the notes of bugle, trumpet,
  bag-pipe, and drum, answered and prolonged by a hundred woodland
  echoes. ‘I never beheld so delightful a prospect,’ wrote a
  wounded officer at Albany a fortnight after.

  “Rogers with the Rangers, and Gage with the light infantry, led
  the way in whaleboats, followed by Bradstreet with his corps of
  boatman, armed and drilled as soldiers. Then came the main body.
  The central column of regulars was commanded by Lord Howe, his
  own regiment, the fifty-fifth, in the van, followed by the Royal
  Americans, the twenty-seventh, forty-fourth, forty-sixth, and
  eightieth infantry, and the Highlanders of the forty-second, with
  their major, Duncan Campbell of Inverawe, silent and gloomy amid
  the general cheer, for his soul was dark with foreshadowings of
  death. With this central column came what are described as two
  floating castles, which were no doubt batteries to cover the
  landing of the troops. On the right hand and the left were the
  provincials, uniformed in blue, regiment after regiment, from
  Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode
  Island. Behind them all came the batteaux, loaded with stores
  and baggage, and the heavy flatboats that carried the artillery,
  while a rear-guard of provincials and regulars closed the long
  procession.”

It will be unnecessary to go into the details of this disastrous
campaign as it is not only well known to most of you but three
papers bearing on the subject will be read at this meeting.[19]
Briefly the army landed at the foot of Lake George the morning of
the 6th and the afternoon of the same day Lord Howe at the head of
a Ticonderoga party was killed at the outlet of Trout Brook. This
is the beginning of the end as Lord Howe was the real head of the
army. Abercrombie took until the eighth to make up his mind what
to do and this interim gave the French time to build the fatal
breastworks across the ridge about one-half mile west of the Fort
and enabled Lévis to arrive with reinforcements.

As the breastworks play a most important part in the Battle it
will perhaps be well to again quote from Parkman who gives a most
comprehensive description.

  “The trees that covered the ground were hewn down by thousands,
  the tops lopped off, and the trunks piled one upon another to
  form a massive breastwork. The line followed the top of the
  ridge, along which it zigzagged in such a manner that the whole
  front could be swept by flank-fires of musketry and grape. It
  was so high that nothing could be seen over it but the crowns of
  the soldiers’ hats. The upper tier was formed of single logs, in
  which notches were cut to serve as loopholes; and in some places
  sods and bags of sand were piled along the top, with narrow
  spaces to fire through. From the central part of the line the
  ground sloped away like a natural glacis; while at the sides,
  and especially on the left, it was undulating and broken. Over
  this whole space, to the distance of a musket-shot from the
  works, the forest was cut down, and the trees left lying where
  they fell among the stumps, with tops turned outwards, forming
  one vast abattis, which, as a Massachusetts officer says, looked
  like a forest laid flat by a hurricane. But the most formidable
  obstruction was immediately along the front of the breastworks,
  where the ground was covered with heavy boughs, overlapping and
  interlaced, with sharpened points bristling into the face of the
  assailant like the quills of a porcupine. As these works were all
  of wood, no vestige of them remains. The earth-works now shown
  to tourists as the lines of Montcalm were begun four days after
  the battle to replace the log breastwork; and though on the same
  ground are not on the same plan.”

Behind these breastworks the battalions of LaSarre and Languedoc
were posted on the left under Bourlamaque, the first battalion of
Berry with that of Royal Roussillon in the center under Montcalm
and those of LaReine, Béarn and Guienne on the right under Lévis.
A detachment of volunteers occupied the low grounds between the
breastworks and the outlet of Lake George and on the side toward
Lake Champlain were stationed 450 regulars and Canadians, about
3,600 in all.

It is always easy to criticise an event after it has occurred, but
the result certainly shows that Abercrombie could not have planned
his campaign more to the advantage of the French. He first gave
them time to build those formidable breastworks and then instead
of choosing any one of half a dozen plans which would have brought
victory, he decided to throw his army unsupported by artillery,
which was still at Lake George, at the strongest part of the
French position, he himself staying in safety at the saw mill
(about which we heard this afternoon in the able paper read by Mr.
Delano at the unveiling of the tablet) a mile and a half in the
rear of his army.[20]

The sad result is too well known to dwell on and we pass at once
to the part played by the Black Watch. They, with the 55th were to
have formed the reserve but impatient at being left in the rear
the Highlanders could not be restrained and were soon in the front
endeavoring to cut their way through the fallen trees with their
broadswords. Captain John Campbell, who was one of the two soldiers
presented to George II in 1743, with a few men, were the only ones
to force their way over the breastworks and they were instantly
dispatched with the bayonet.

Lieut. William Grant of the Regiment writes as follows:

  “The attack began a little past one in the afternoon and about
  two the fire became general on both sides. It was exceedingly
  heavy and without intercession insomuch as the oldest soldier
  never saw so furious and incessant a fire. The fire at Fontenoy
  was nothing to it. I saw both.”

An officer of the 55th regiment, of which Lord Howe had been the
commander, wrote as follows:

  “With a mixture of esteem, grief and envy, I am penetrated by
  the great loss and immortal glory acquired by the Highlanders
  engaged in the late bloody affair. Impatient for the fray, they
  rushed forward to the entrenchments which many of them actually
  mounted, their intrepidity was rather animated than dampened by
  witnessing their comrades fall on every side. They seemed more
  anxious to avenge the fate of their deceased friends than to
  avoid a like death. In their co-operation we trust soon to give a
  good account of the enemy and of ourselves. There is much harmony
  and friendship between the two regiments.”

Even the French were impressed with the valor of the Black Watch as
Garneau writes in L’Histoire du Canada.[21]

  “The Highlanders above all, under Lord John Murray, covered
  themselves with glory. They formed the head of the troops
  confronting the Canadians, their light and picturesque costume
  distinguishing them from all other soldiers amid the flame and
  smoke. This corps lost half of its men and 25 of its officers
  were killed or severely wounded.”

Lossing writes,

  “The whole army seemed envious to excell but the Scotch Highland
  Regiment of Lord John Murray was foremost in the conflict and
  suffered the severest loss.”[22]

The following letters from Captain Allan Campbell are of interest:

      Camp at Lake George, 11th July, 1758.

  Dr. Broyr.,--The 8th of this month we had a hot brush at the
  lines of Ticonderoga where we lost a considerable number of
  men and officers. The officers of your acquentance wounded are
  Major Campbell and his son. Both in their arms, and I hope
  will do well. Captain Stratchur slightly in the breast, Ltt.
  Archd. Campbell Sheriff Badly in the Breast, Lt. John Campbell
  Glendaruel slightly in the arm, Capt. Ltt. John Campbell Duneaves
  killed, Ltt. Hugh Macpherson ditto, Capt. Graham, Duchra, and
  Broyr. Both wounded slightly and several other offrs. of the
  Regt, but not of your acquentance are killed and wounded.

  Our Regt, acquired great glory by their good behaviour of both
  men and officers, tho’ we were unsuccessfull. I have the pleasure
  to aquent you that both my nephew George and I eskeaped without a
  scratch, tho’ both in the heat of the action. George is a pritty
  Lad: he’s now a Ltt. in Coll. Gages Regt, of Lt. Infantry. Your
  son the Major was well about 2 months ago at Philadelphia. We are
  now at the end of Lake George Encampt. I have told you now all
  the news that can occurr to me or that I have time to write you,
  and I thought it my duty to acquent you and my other Broyrs. of
  my being well after a smart action. I have no time to write you
  more being excessively hurried having no Body to assist me in the
  affairs of my Company having my three Ltts. killed or wounded
  viz. Ltt. Balie killed and Ltts. Archd. Campbell and William
  Grant wounded. I’ll write you very fully in my nixt. My best
  wishes to my sister, to your family and all our friends, and I am
  Dr. Bryr, your most affec. and Lov. Broyr, while

      Allan Campbell.


      New York, 6th January 1759.

  Dr. Brother,--I writt you the 11th July in a great hurry after
  our retreat from Ticonderoga to let you know of mine and George’s
  welfair, after that unlucky afair, where severall of our friends
  and a great many worthy Fellows suffer’d. Our Regt, lost more
  than any other Corps at the attack of the Lines. We have had
  killed and wounded since the beginning of the Campaign 520
  (officers included) of which about 300 were left dead on the
  field or have dyed of their wounds, and of 37 officers that were
  present with the Regt. that day 11 only came off unhurt, of which
  number I was lucky enough to be one.

  You would certainly hear before now of poor Major Campbell
  Inveraw’s death, he liv’d about a fortnight after he receiv’d his
  wound, the Doctors thought it necessary that his arm should be
  cut off, and he dyed soon after the operation at Fort Edward, all
  the rest of our wounded officers are quite recover’d except his
  son, Sandy, Jock Campbell Glendaruel, and Archie Shirreff, but
  they are out of all danger, only their cure will be tedious.

  Poor George had a narrow escape the day we landed at the French
  end of the Lake, having had a scratch along the face with a
  musquet Ball. He was in a smart little action that happen’d in
  the woods a mounth afterwards between a detachment of 500 of our
  army under the command of Major Rogers and much the same number
  of Indians French and Canadians, where the latter were repulsed
  with the loss of 100 men, and I assure you his behaviour at that
  affair was much aplauded by his Broyr. officers on their return
  to the Army.

  He’s now second oldest Lieut, in General Gage’s Regt. of light
  arm’d infantry, for which he’s obliged to the late Major
  Campbell, Inveraw; and as they talk at present of agmenting that
  corps, he’ll have a good chance of getting Higher up, and in any
  event he’s better off by being so High in that Regt. as they are
  now an Establish’d Corps, than if he had staid in ours, where he
  could be but a young Lieut. His Coll, has a great regard for him,
  and very Deservedly for he’s a lad of good morals, a good spirit,
  and very fit for his Business. He has acted as Adjutant to that
  Regt. since July last, by which he has nothing yet but Troble,
  there being no Adjutant allow’d, and that his Collonel means it
  for him; if he’s lucky enough to get that, I think he’s very well
  provided for for the time he has served.

  I have advanc’d him Twenty Guineas for which he gave me a Bill
  on you. I hope you’ll not Disaprove of my conduct for doing it,
  nor blame him for running so much short, when I explain to you
  the cause of it; its trew he came over very well Riged out,
  but his changing Corps put him under a necessity of Buying new
  Regimentals, as these Differ in Colours from the rest of the
  Army, being Brown, besides his expense must be greater upon his
  first comming in among Strangers, and he had the misfortune of
  being sent a recruiting last winter, which really is a misfortune
  to an officer in this Country unless he is very carfull and
  happens to be successful, and I belive George lost by it. This I
  ashure you is truth, and when you consider it was owing to these
  accidents, that he could not possibly guard against, I am hopfull
  you’l easily forgive him. I was likewise oblig’d to advance our
  Unkle Corries’ son, Colin, Twenty two Pounds eighteen shillings
  and tenpence or he must have gone naked, having lost all his
  things at Fort William Henry. I have sent both Bills to Brother
  Robert. George and Colin are sent this winter a Recruiting to
  Pensilvania.

  I had a letter dated the 30 Novr. from my nephew, the Major, from
  where Fort du Quesne stood, he was then very well. I expect dayly
  to hear from him, he’s had as troublesome and Fatigueing Campaign
  of it, as ever any Body had, our Army has been above a Month in
  Winter Quarters befor thers got to Fort du Quesne, which the
  French burnt upon ther near aproach, and an immense long march
  they have to get back to Philadelphia, wher ther Regt, is to be
  Quarter’s this winter, and where I intend to go and see him, when
  I hear of ther arrival, its about 100 miles from this place that
  our Regt, is now quartere’d in.

  We long much for a Pacquet here having no news from Europe for
  some months, I take the opportunity of writing you now by the

  There is no News here at Present. All our Friends in this Country
  are Well. Remember my best wishes to my Sister, and the rest
  of your Family whom may God Almighty bless and I ever am, Dr.
  Brother, your affec. and Lov. Broyr.

      Allan Campbell.[23]


I also give in full the letter written by Capt. James Murray to his
brother, Mr. Murray of Strowan, dated Albany, July 19, 1758, as
his description of the country and the events during and after the
battle lend color to the picture.[24]

  My Dear Brother:--The last letter I wrote you was dated from Fort
  Edward camp about 18th June. We proceeded on to Lake George where
  Fort William Henry formerly stood which was taken and destroyed
  by the French last year, where we remained until the 5th curt.
  and then the whole army embarked on the lake in batteaux that
  hold 23 men with a month’s provisions all the artillery stores
  was likewise embarked, and everything else belonging to an army.
  We were divided into brigades. There was in all about 5,000
  regulars and 12,000 provincials. We had also light infantry and
  rangers who had whale-boats which are the lightest and best going
  boats that can be made. We put off about 8 and got fairly into
  the lake which I took to be about 20 miles long and not above two
  miles at the broadest part of it. There are several small islands
  which are quite covered with wood and all around the lake is
  very hilly and quite covered with woods, as the most part of the
  country is, at least what I have seen on’t.

  This lake abounds in fine trout the meat of which is red, pearch,
  suckers and several other sorts of fish. There is also plenty
  of beavers. On the side of the lake there is plenty of deer but
  I have not seen any since I came to the country. Sometimes when
  I have been out on command I have killed rattle snakes about
  four feet long and as thick as the small of one’s leg, with 18
  rattles, which altogether might be about four inches long. They
  say some have twenty or more. They have both teeth and a sting.
  The rattles being at the tail makes them that they can stand up
  on end and spring a short way at one. When touched they make
  a great noise with their rattles. Their bite is not so bad as
  called for it can be easily cured with oil or salt. They smell
  exactly like a goat, rather ranker if possible before they are
  seized but afterwards have almost no smell at all. They make the
  richest and best soup that can be which I eat of and like much.
  The meat is but insipid.

  The 6th we disembarked at the lower end of the lake. In the
  morning out light infantry and rangers had some skirmishing with
  the French pickets. Lord Howe was killed at the second shot and
  he is very much regretted. There was taken that day about 150
  prisoners, five of whom were officers. They had a great many
  killed so that very few of their pickets escaped which consisted
  in all of about 350.

  The next day being the 7th, we were making preparations to invest
  a fort called Theenderora which is five miles from Lake George
  and is situate on a neck of land that runs into Lake Champlain.
  As to the dimensions of that lake I can’t say, and marched
  within a mile and half of it that evening. The next morning the
  light infantry made the French sentries and small posts retire to
  their entrenchments for the French had an encampment about half
  a cannon shot before their fort, and were entrenched after the
  following manner: They had large cut trees one laid above another
  a man’s height and in the outside there was brush and logs for
  about 15 paces from it which made it impossible to force their
  breastworks without cannon which we had not taken up that length
  as then. They were also under cover of the fort or if we could
  beat them out of their trenches, they could have retired pretty
  safely.

  Between one and two we marched up and attacked the trenches
  and got within twenty paces of them and had as hot a fire for
  about three hours as possibly could be, we all the time seeing
  but their hats and the end of their muskets. About half an hour
  before we were obliged to retire I received a shot through my
  thigh after which I stayed a few minutes but finding if I stayed
  any longer my thigh would turn stiff and losing a great deal of
  blood I with help got into the road and that evening with Capt.
  Gordon Graham, our paymaster, got into a whaleboat and against
  the next morning got to the upper end of Lake George and was
  transported down here. I am confined to my bed but the surgeons
  say my wound looks as well as can be expected, nor is there any
  sort of danger in it as it has only grazed the bone, so I shall
  be well soon again. I am in perfect good health, have a good
  appetite and sleep tolerably well.

  Our regiment has suffered much. There was the captain, lieutenant
  and six subalterns killed on the spot and since the major and
  the lieutenant have died of their wounds. The colonel, four
  captains, and twelve subalterns are wounded. 180 men killed
  and 280 wounded. None of the other regiments’ losses were near
  so great. Capt. Stewart was not touched, Capt. Sterling nor
  Farquharson were not there so are well, but Lieut. Farquharson’s
  younger brother was killed. Lieut. David Mills, my lieutenant,
  is not ill wounded and is pretty well, so if you would inform
  his father-in-law, Mr. Hamilton, of Hutcheson, who stays near
  Glasgow, you would oblige me. Neil Stewart at Perth knows him.

  I received a letter from Lord John 15th May letting me know you
  are all well which gave me a great deal of pleasure but it would
  much more so to hear from some of you for it is very long since I
  had that satisfaction, the last being at Ireland, for Lord John
  wrote me no particulars.

  Offer my humble duty to my dear mother and elsewhere due and best
  love to dear Lady Charlotte, Lady Sinclair, George, Charlotte and
  Invercauld, and my best blessing attend all the young ones. My
  kind compliments to Shusy Moray and tell her I had her hair about
  my neck when I received my wound which might have probably gone
  to my heart if it had not been wounded already.

  I am ever your most effectionate brother,

      James Murray.


Thus had the army which landed so proudly two days before been
disastrously repulsed, with a loss in killed and wounded and
missing of nineteen hundred and forty-four officers and men. In his
report of July 12, 1758, Abercrombie gives the casualty of the 42nd
as follows:

  “Killed--Capt. Lt. John Campbell; Lts. George Farquharson, Hugh
  McPherson, William Bailey, John Sutherland; Ensigns Peter Stewart
  and George Rattray.

  Wounded--Major Duncan Campbell; Captains Gordon Graham, Thomas
  Graeme, John Campbell, James Stewart, James Murray; Lieutenants
  William Grant, Robert Gray, John Campbell, James Grant, John
  Graham, Alexander Campbell, Alexander McIntosh, Archibald
  Campbell, David Mill,[25] Patrick Balnevis; Ensigns John Smith
  and Peter Grant.

  Summary--1 major wounded, captains 1 killed, 4 wounded;
  lieutenants 4 killed, 11 wounded; ensigns 2 killed, 2 wounded;
  adjutants 1 wounded; quarter master 1 wounded; sergeants 6
  killed, 13 wounded, rank and file 190 killed, 265 wounded.”

Stewart of Garth writes as follows:

  “Of these the 42nd regiment had 8 officers, 9 serjeants, and
  297 men killed, and 17 officers, 10 serjeants, and 306 soldiers
  wounded. The officers were, Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe,
  Captain John Campbell, Lieutenants George Farquharson, Hugh
  McPherson, William Baillie, and John Sutherland; Ensigns Patrick
  Stewart of Bonskied and George Rattray killed; Captains Gordon
  Graham, Thomas Graham of Duchray, John Campbell of Strachur,
  James Stewart of Urrad, James Murray (afterward General);
  Lieutenants James Grant, Robert Gray, John Campbell, William
  Grant, John Graham, brother of Duchray, Alexander Campbell,
  Alexander Mackintosh, Archibald Campbell, David Miller, Patrick
  Balneaves; and Ensigns John Smith and Peter Grant, wounded.”

Capt. James Murray writes from Albany 17th August, 1758:[26]

  “As I observed in my last, our regiment has suffered greatly. The
  Major has since died of his wounds, Sandy Farquharson has got
  his lieutenancy by seniority which one would not have thought
  that the youngest ensign of the additionals would have been so
  soon a lieutenant. I am recovering pretty well and can walk about
  although I am much pained in my knee but hope will be able to
  soon joint the regiment.”

Capt. James Stewart writes 14th July from Lake George:[27]

  “That all the Captains were wounded, less or more, excepting
  Captains McNeil and Allan Campbell, that Major Campbell got his
  right arm wounded, but not dangerous and his son, Lieutenant
  Alexander Campbell had his arm broke betwixt the elbow and
  shoulder, but he was in a good way.”

Parkman states that Lt. Alexander Campbell was severely wounded but
reached Scotland alive and died in Glasgow.[28]

Abercrombie reports to Pitt from Lake George, Aug. 19, 1758;

  “Major Duncan Campbell of the 42nd who was wounded in the arm at
  the battle on the 8th was obliged to have it cut off and died
  soon thereafter.”[29]

It would seem therefore that the wounds of Major Campbell and his
son were not necessarily fatal and that modern surgery would have
cured them. The following however, taken from Garneau’s L’Histoire
du Canada might explain the unexpected mortality. “Scarcely any of
the wounded Highlanders ever recovered and even those sent home as
invalids; their sores cankered, owing to the broken glass, ragged
bits of metal, etc., used by the Canadians instead of shot.”[30]

Or this extract from letter of Brig. General James Wolfe to Lord
George Sackville:

      Halifax 24″ May 1758.

  “Some of the Regiments of this Army have 300 or 400 men eat up
  with the Scurvey. All of them that are wounded or hurt by any
  accident run great risks of their lives from the corrupted state
  of the blood.

  “The curious part of the barbarity is that the scoundrels
  of Contractors can afford the fresh meat in many places and
  circumstances as cheap as the salt.”

[Illustration: Original headstone at Grave of Major Duncan Campbell
of Inverawe.

(Jane McCrea lot in Union Cemetery, between Fort Edward and Hudson
Falls.)]

Abercrombie states in his report of July 12, 1758,

  “I sent the wounded officers and the men that could be moved to
  Fort Edward and Albany.”

Major Campbell was sent to Fort Edward and upon his death nine days
after the battle he was buried in the family lot of the Gilchrists,
in the old cemetery at Fort Edward. The body was moved to the
Gilchrist lot in the new Union cemetery between Sandy Hill and Fort
Edward in 1871, and in 1920 was moved again to the Jane McCrea lot
in the same cemetery. The original stone may still be seen and
bears the inscription: “Here Lyes the body of Duncan Campbell of
Inversaw, Esqr Major to The old Highland Regt. Aged 55 Years. Who
died The 17th July, 1758, of wounds he received in the attack of
the retrenchments of Ticonderoga or Carillon, 8th July, 1758.”

Stewart of Garth says,

  “The old Highland Regiment having suffered so severely * * * they
  were not employed again that year.”

In the N. Y. Colonial Records, however, we find that some regulars
of the 42nd and 6th Regts. amounting to 155 men (probably one
company of each) were with Bradstreet in his exposition against
Fort Frontenac.[31]

In Abercrombie’s report of Aug. 19, 1758, he states that part of
the additional companies of the 42nd were sent to reinforce Brig.
General Provost at Fort Edward and that one company of the 42nd
and some of the recovering men were stationed at Albany. From this
it might be inferred that the only part of the Black Watch fit for
duty were the three additional companies which had not been in
the battle of July 8th and it is possible that the one company of
the 42nd that had been blown out of its course to Antigua and had
not arrived at New York until June did not get further north than
Albany. The winter quarters of the 42nd for 1758 were at New York.
(Abercrombie to Pitt, No. 25, 1758.)[32]

The official title is now changed to the “42nd or Royal Regiment
of foot,” and the regiment is commonly called the Royal
Highlanders. It has erroneously been stated that the Black Watch
was granted this honor of being a “Royal” regiment because of its
gallantry at Ticonderoga, but it is all the more to its credit that
it had earned this distinction before the battle at Ticonderoga.
The title was granted by special warrant dated July 22, 1758, while
the news of the defeat did not reach London until the arrival of
Abercrombie’s aide de camp with dispatches Aug. 20, 1758.

A copy of the warrant is as follows:

  George R

  We being desirous to distinguish Our Forty Second Regiment of
  Foot with some mark of Our Royal favor, Our Will and Pleasure
  therefore is, and we do hereby direct, that from henceforth Our
  said regiment be called, and distinguished by the title and name
  of Our Forty-Second, or Royal Highland Regiment of Foot, in all
  commissions, orders, and writings, that shall hereafter be made
  out, or issued for and concerning the said regiment. Given at Our
  Court at Kensington this 22nd day of July 1758, in the thirty
  second year of Our reign. By His Majesty’s command.

      (Signed) BARRINGTON.


The vacancies occasioned in the 42nd were filled up in regular
succession and the seven companies which had been ordered at the
same time as the change of title were immediately recruited. These
were completed in three months and embodied at Perth, October
1758, each company being 120 men strong, all with few exceptions
Highlanders and hardy and temperate in their habits. (Lord John
Murray’s orders were preemptory that none but Highlanders be taken,
but a few O’Donnels, O’Lachlans and O’Briens passed muster as
MacDonnels, MacLachlans and MacBriars.)

These seven companies with the three additional companies raised in
1757 were formed into a Second Battalion. The officers appointed
to the seven new companies were Robert Anstruther, who was senior
captain and served as Major, Francis MacLean, Alexander Sinclair,
John Stewart of Stenton, William Murray of Lintrose, Archibald
Campbell, Alexander Reid, and Robert Arbuthnot, to be captains;
Alexander MacLean, George Grant, George Sinclair, Gordon Clunes,
Adam Stewart, John Robertson, son of Lude, John Grant, James
Fraser, George Leslie, John Campbell, Alexander Stewart, Duncan
Richardson and Robert Robertson, to be lieutenants and Patrick
Sinclair, John Macintosh, James MacDuff, Thomas Fletcher, Alexander
Donaldson, William MacLean, and William Brown, to be ensigns.

The seven new companies embarked for the West Indies where they
joined with the Old Buffs, Kings, 6th, 63rd, 64th, 800 marines and
a detachment of artillery amounting in all to 5,560 men under the
command of Major Generals Hopson and Barrington and of Brigadier
Generals Haldane, Armiger, Trapaud and Clavering, in an exposition
against Martinique and Gaudaloupe. This resulted in the capture of
Gaudaloupe but was not altogether a success and a great many men
were lost by fever and sickness. Of the Royal Highlanders Ensign
MacLean was killed, Lieutenants MacLean, Leslie, Sinclair and
Robertson were wounded, and Major Anstruther and Captain Arbuthnot
died of the fever. One hundred and six privates were killed,
wounded or died of disease.

This was a severe initiation for the new recruits who had been
herding sheep on their native hills nine months before, but as has
always been the case with the Black Watch they acquitted themselves
with distinction. The seven companies were then embarked for New
York to join the First Battalion where they arrived in July. They
just missed being at the capture of Ticonderoga. Major Gordon
Graham was ordered at the end of July by General Amherst then at
Crown Point to take command of the seven companies and to march
them up to Oswego. In August they were ordered to join the First
Battalion, Capt. Stewart with 150 men being left at Oswego and the
First and Second Battalions, now united, served together for the
rest of the campaign.

We will now return to the Veterans of the previous year. After
wintering in New York (or on Long Island, as another authority
states) the old Black Watch now the first Battalion of the Royal
Highlanders, recruited again to its full strength and the three
additional companies now a part of the Second Battalion, joined
Amherst at Fort Edward in June, 1759.[33] Col. Grant of the 42nd
with the Royal Highlanders and light infantry of the army moved
forward to Lake George the 20th and the main part of the army
followed on the 21st. For five years now Lake George had been the
annual mustering place of armies.

The campaign this season comprehended three very important
enterprises--Wolfe was to attack Quebec from Lower Canada, Prideaux
was to proceed against Niagara, and Amherst, now Commander in Chief
and successor of General Abercrombie, was to drive the French from
Lake Champlain and if possible join Wolfe on the St. Lawrence.

The army under Amherst consisted of the Royals, 17th, 27th, Royal
Highlanders, two battalions of the 55th, Montgomery’s Highlanders,
nine battalions of Provincials, and a battalion of light infantry
and a body of Rangers and Indians with a detachment of artillery.
When joined by the 2d battalion of the Royal Americans from the
West Indies, this army amounted to 14,500 men.

Major Alexander Campbell of the 77th writes from Fort Edward, June
19th, 1759:

  “Our General is beloved by his soldiers, Honoured and Esteem’d
  by his officers, Carful of mens lives and healths, in short he
  is the man I would choose to serve under of any I know in the
  service. Our Regiment are healthy and in High spirits as are the
  whole army, and I hope we soon will stricke a stroke that will
  bring credite and Glory to our General and Army and Satisfaction
  to our Country and friends.”

Amherst never remained long in one place without building a fort.
Fortified places were built at intervals of three or four miles
along the road to Fort Edward and especially at the station called
Halfway Brook, while for the whole distance a broad belt of wood on
both sides was cut down and burned to deprive a skulking enemy of
cover. At Lake George he started a fort, now called Fort George,
the ruins of which are in the Lake George Battle Ground Park of
which this Association is custodian.

July 21st, 1759, Lake George again witnessed a military pageant as
the army embarked for its second attack on Fort Ticonderoga. At
daylight they landed, beat back a French detachment and marched
by the portage road to the sawmill. There was little resistance
and the army marched to the former line of entrenchments which had
proved so fatal to Abercrombie. These had been reconstructed partly
of earth and partly of logs, and as the French made no attempt at
their defence the English encamped along their front and found them
excellent shelter from the cannon of the fort. It is the general
impression that the French retreated with only faint resistance and
that there was hardly a shot fired at the second attempt to capture
Fort Carrillon but the following letter from Capt. Murray would
correct this impression:

      “Camp at the Lines of Burning Theanderoga, 27 July, 1758.

  My Dear Brother:--I write you these few lines to acquaint you
  that I am in perfect good health and that the army landed at this
  end of the lake the 22nd, invested the Fort the 23rd and was
  very buisy carying on the worcks till the 26th in the night, at
  which time we had three batteries ready to open, when the enemy
  abbandoned and set fire to the fort. During the time that the
  enemy remained they could not keep a hotter fire, for I dare say
  that fired ten thousand cannon shott and five hundred bombs and I
  don’t believe there has been forty men killed and wounded during
  that hott fire, altho’ all the Bombs fell in different parts
  among us and that we were nigh point blank of the cannon shott
  but the line that had been of so much hurt to us last year saved
  our men this.

      Your most afft. Brother, James Murray.”

I also add Amherst’s report to Governor James DeLancey:

      Camp at Ticonderoga 27th July 1759.[34]

  Sir:--

  On Saturday morning last I embarked with the army at Lake George,
  the next day landed without opposition and proceeded to the saw
  mills, and took post on the commanding grounds, meeting only a
  trifling opposition from the enemy. We lay on our arms all night
  and early on the 23rd we continued our march to the ground which
  I took possession of in the forenoon, the enemy having abandoned
  the lines without destroying them, first having carried off
  their effects as well as sent away the greatest part of their
  troops. As soon as I was set down before the place and after
  having reconnoitered it, I ordered the trenches to be opened
  and batteries to be made, which were finished last night, and
  were to have opened at break of day, but the enemy did not think
  proper to wait till then, having about ten of the clock yesterday
  evening blown up a part of the Fort, and made their escape all
  to about 20 deserters. Our loss considering the fire we sustained
  is inconsiderable. We have only two officers killed, vis. Colonel
  Townshend, Deputy Adjutant General and Ensign Harrison of late
  Forbe’s.

Bourlamaque had on receipt of orders from Vaudreuil retired down
Lake Champlain leaving four hundred men under Hebecourt to defend
the fort as long as possible and then to abandon Ticonderoga and
later when pressed Crown Point and to retreat to Isle-oux-Noix at
the outlet of Lake Champlain, where defense was to be made to the
last extremity. When the English battery was ready to open fire
Hebecourt saw that further resistance was useless and lighting a
slow match to the magazine the French escaped down the lake in
their boats and a few hours later an explosion which hurled one
bastion of old Fort Carrillon skyward shook the promontory. Thus
did French Carillon become English Ticonderoga and “Ticonderoga
1758-9” should be among the battle honors to be borne on the colors
of the Black Watch. It is true that these honorary distinctions are
awarded by the King only in case of victory but Ticonderoga 1758-9
would certainly be as much a victory as “South Africa 1899-1902,”
which has been granted. South Africa was not all victory and the
Black Watch suffered at Magersfontein as it did at Ticonderoga
under Abercrombie.

The length of time elapsed since the battle would also be no
objection to the honor being now granted as it was not until 1910,
two and one half centuries later that the armies that upheld
British honor on the Coast of Morocco were authorized to bear
“Tangier 1662-1680” on their colors and appointments.

[Illustration: Copyright 1930 by William H. Hill, Fort Edward

FORT EDWARD, 1759]

Ticonderoga is the one place on the American continent where Great
Britain and France, Canada and the United States can all unite on
one common ground. The Yankees and British can meet here and clasp
hands over the time when they once fought together and there is
not even a sectional feeling which detracts from the unanimity.
The North, South, East and West of the United States all join with
equal fervor. Each nation had its defeats here at different times
but each also had its victories. Therefore there is no battle honor
which could be conferred on any British regiment that would
please more people of different nations than “Ticonderoga 1758-9.”
The fact that there is at present in the village of Ticonderoga
a public library and historical building dedicated to a British
Regiment, even though this same regiment in its line of duty fought
against us in a later war, is sufficient proof that we consider
Ticonderoga of international history and above matters of local
prejudice.

The rest of the story is soon told. Crown Point was captured and
the army was to have moved forward to Isle oux-Noix and to the
St. Lawrence but a succession of storms so delayed operations
that further active movements were abandoned for the remainder of
the season. Amherst profiting by the fatal precipitation of his
predecessor was slow but sure and in this campaign was successful
in every enterprise that he undertook.

After the capture of Crown Point the army under Amherst was mainly
employed in building operations on Lake Champlain, Fort Amherst at
Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga in place of old Fort Carrillon
at Ticonderoga. The Black Watch was stationed at Crown Point and
helped to build Fort Amherst. In November, they went into camp for
the winter and in his report of “Garrisons and Winter Quarters of
His Majesty’s forces in North America under the command of His
Excellency, Major General Amherst, Headquarters at New York, 15
Dec., 1759” in the Public Record Office, the stations of the Black
Watch were as follows: 1st Battalion Royal Highland Regiment, 1
company Halfway Brook, 5 companies Fort Edward, 1 company Fort
Miller, 1 company Saratoga, 1 company Stillwater and 1 company
Halfmoon, 2d Battalion Royal Highland Regiment, Albany, one
Battalion of the Inniskilling (27th Foot) and two companies of the
Rangers were left at Crown Point, six companies Late Brig. Gen’l
Forbe’s (17th Foot) at Ticonderoga, and four companies 17th Foot at
Fort George. The following season (1760) the Black Watch was with
Amherst at the capture of Montreal which was the end of the French
domain on the American Continent.

In 1761 the Black Watch with ten regiments embarked for Barbadoes
there to join an armament against Martinique and Havana. After
the surrender of Havana, the first battalion of the 42nd and
Montgomery’s Highlanders embarked for New York which they reached
in the end of October, 1762. Before leaving Cuba most of the second
battalion of the 42nd fit for service were consolidated with the
first, and the remainder shipped to Scotland where they were
reduced the following year.

The Black Watch was stationed at Albany until the summer of 1763,
when they, with a detachment of Montgomery’s Highlanders and
another of the 60th, under command of Col. Henry Boquet were sent
to the relief of Fort Pitt then besieged by the Indians. The 42nd
passed the winter at Fort Pitt and during the summer of 1764,
eight companies were sent with the army of Boquet against the Ohio
Indians. After subduing the Indians they returned to Fort Pitt,
January 1765. The regiment remained in Pennsylvania until the month
of July, 1767, when it embarked at Philadelphia for Ireland. Such
of the men who preferred to remain in America were permitted to
join other regiments. These volunteers were so numerous that along
with those who had been previously sent home disabled and others
discharged and settled in America, the regiment that returned was
very small in proportion to that which had left Scotland.

Let us now turn our attention to Major Duncan Campbell as not only
would no sketch of the Black Watch of Ticonderoga be complete
without the legend with which his name is associated, but we are
perhaps more interested in him than any other officer of the
Regiment of that time because he lies buried in the cemetry midway
between Hudson Falls (formerly Sandy Hill) and Fort Edward. The
other officers and men who were killed July 8, 1758, were doubtless
buried on the field of battle and if the graves were ever marked,
these marks have long since been destroyed.

No ghost story is more widely known or better authenticated than
that of Duncan Campbell of Inverawe. It has been made the subject
of an address before this Association by the late Robert O. Bascom
at the meeting of July 30, 1901, and has been repeated in many
forms and in various publications but it will bear still one more
repetition. The following is taken from Parkman’s “Montcalm and
Wolfe” and is the story as was told by Dean Stanley and endorsed by
the family of the hero of the tale:

  “The ancient castle of Inverawe stands by the banks of the Awe,
  in the midst of the wild and picturesque scenery of the Western
  Highlands. Late one evening, before the middle of the last
  century, as the laird, Duncan Campbell, sat alone in the old
  hall, there was a loud knocking at the gate; and, opening it, he
  saw a stranger, with torn clothing and kilt besmeared with blood,
  who in a breathless voice begged for asylum. He went on to say
  that he had killed a man in a fray, and that the pursuers were
  at his heels. Campbell promised to shelter him. “Swear on your
  dirk!”[35] said the stranger; and Campbell swore. He then led
  him to a secret recess in the depths of the castle. Scarcely was
  he hidden when again there was a loud knocking at the gate, and
  two armed men appeared. “Your cousin Donald has been murdered,
  and we are looking for the murderer!” Campbell, remembering his
  oath, professed to have no knowledge of the fugitive; and the
  men went on their way. The laird, in great agitation, lay down
  to rest in a large dark room where at length he fell asleep.
  Waking suddenly in bewilderment and terror, he saw the ghost of
  the murdered Donald standing by his bedside, and heard a hollow
  voice pronounce the words: “Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been
  shed. Shield not the murderer.” In the morning Campbell went to
  the hiding place of the guilty man and told him that he could
  harbor him no longer. “You have sworn on your dirk” he replied;
  and the laird of Inverawe, greatly perplexed and troubled, made a
  compromise between conflicting duties, promised not to betray his
  guest, led him to the neighboring mountain (Ben Cruachan) and hid
  him in a cave.[36]

  In the next night, as he lay tossing in feverish slumbers, the
  same stern voice awoke him, the ghost of his cousin Donald stood
  again at his bedside, and again he heard the same appalling
  words: “Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been shed. Shield not the
  murderer!” At break of day he hastened, in strange agitation,
  to the cave; but it was empty, the stranger had gone. At night,
  as he strove in vain to sleep, the vision appeared once more,
  ghastly pale, but less stern of aspect than before. “Farewell,
  Inverawe!” it said; “Farewell, till we meet at TICONDEROGA!”

  The strange name dwelt in Campbell’s memory. He had joined the
  Black Watch, or Forty-Second Regiment, then employed in keeping
  order in the turbulent Highlands. In time he became its major;
  and, a year or two after the war broke out, he went with it to
  America. Here, to his horror, he learned that it was ordered to
  the attack of Ticonderoga. His story was well known among his
  brother officers. They combined among themselves to disarm his
  fears; and when they reached the fatal spot they told him on the
  eve of the battle, “This is not Ticonderoga; we are not there
  yet; this is Fort George.”[37] But in the morning he came to
  them with haggard looks. “I have seen him! You have deceived me!
  He came to my tent last night! This is Ticonderoga! I shall die
  today!” and his prediction was fulfilled.”

As will be seen by the preceding pages, Inverawe lived nine days
after the battle and was not even mortally wounded if it had been
possible in those times to have had antiseptic treatment, but the
real point of the legend is that he had been warned of Ticonderoga
when he did not know there was such a place, years before there was
any prospect of his being sent there and when Ticonderoga was only
the Indian name for a point of land on a lake in the wilderness of
a far off continent.

To one interested no place could be more fascinating than old
Inverawe;[38] everything connected with it breathes of legend
and romance and naturally this was one of the first places
visited in our Black Watch pilgrimage last summer. Taynuilt, the
railroad station nearest Inverawe is a small village across the
Awe and about a mile away as the crow flies, but to drive to our
destination, one must follow the road two miles up the River to the
old bridge which was being built at the time that the Major left
for the war in America in 1756. The builder was Captain William
Pitman apparently a good friend of Duncan of Inverawe as he charged
him with the safe keeping during his absence of his daughter Janet
and his favorite dog. History does not record what happened to
the dog but the Captain married the daughter and in time Inverawe
became her property.

A Corner of the Ghost Room]

After crossing the Awe the road turns down the north side of the
River and winds through a magnificent park, some of the trees of
which must certainly have been there before the Major’s time. This
is all the more remarkable because with the exception of the parks
of the private estates, Scotland is nearly a treeless country and
even the mountains and wild land which with us would be covered
with forests, have there only grass and heather. Then at the end
of a delightful four mile drive was old Inverawe house and a most
cordial and hospitable welcome from its present owner.

The old house has had many additions in the past one hundred and
fifty years but the entrance hall and the main part of the building
and particularly the room where Duncan Campbell saw the ghost,
are still very much as they were in his time. We endeavored to
learn as much as possible of the family history of the Campbells
of Inverawe, but like the records of the Black Watch of that time,
there was in 1910, little left but tradition.


_The Campbells of Inverawe_

Twenty years have passed since the account of the Black Watch at
Ticonderoga as written for the 1910 meeting of the New York State
Historical Association was published, and while we regret that very
little can be added, we are pleased to say that few corrections
have had to be made in the story as then told. It was thought that
the records of the Regiment of the 18th Century were discovered in
1913 among the military manuscripts in the Royal United Service
Institution, but while they purported to be the original records,
careful examination disclosed that they had been written early in
the nineteenth century so nothing new was learned of the Regiment
of the Ticonderoga period. The preceding pages therefore are
practically unchanged.

The part, however, about the family history of Major Duncan
Campbell of Inverawe has been entirely rewritten. We are indebted
for this additional information to the descendants of Alexander,
a brother of Duncan of Inverawe, to the late Major Sir Duncan
Campbell of Barcaldine, to the late Captain Douglas Wimberly, and
others. No one feature of the Black Watch at Ticonderoga has been
of such general interest as the ghost story of its Major, Duncan
Campbell of Inverawe, and the straightening out of the family
puzzle which was such a mystery in 1910 has been a fascinating
study.

The Major’s memory has been honored recently by two celebrations.
In 1920 when his bones were moved to the Jane McCrea enclosure,
just inside the main gate of the Union Cemetery between Hudson
Falls and Fort Edward, where his ancient tombstone now has the
protection of a high iron fence, and in 1925 when a monument to
the Black Watch and its Major was unveiled at Fort Ticonderoga.
Both occasions were under the auspices of the St. Andrews Society
of Scots of Glens Falls and vicinity, and the New York State
Historical Association.

Of all the new material which has been found since 1910 none is
so important or so interesting as the following letter from Major
Duncan Campbell of Inverawe:

      Albany, 14th March, 1758.

  Dear Sir,

  I received your letter from Inveraw of the 25th November and
  the first from you since we parted, tho I have been informed by
  letters that come to hand, of your writing formerly. The State
  you sent me of my affairs is not very agreeable nor encouraging
  for me to make a retreat that I had in view, and in a little
  time I believe might be in my power but I am not disappointed;
  and notwithstanding I shall do all in my power to assist you. I
  am sorry that no other scheme of living can be accomplished upon
  the fund, than the one fixed on; to me it gives uneasiness of
  minde, tho I’m sensible the consequence may be worse if it is
  not followed, and therefore bear it with concern. I don’t choose
  to mention my reasons or enter upon particulars as letters from
  this part of the world to yours are lyable to inspection and many
  accidents. I see a separation must be that will expose them to
  the disrespect and ridicule of many; coud they live together in
  the way proposed it might prevent much of that but I can’t hope
  or expect it from what I know.

  As to my advice or directions with regard to any plan you, and my
  other freinds, to whom I fear I have given much trouble and to
  whom in any event I shall rekon myself oblig’d there is no sort
  of use for them, you are best judges, and as I am well satisfied
  that everything will be don and ordered for the best, I shall
  be as satisfied with any consequence. I am glade you think of
  raising nurseries and planting, I sent from this Country to be
  forwarded by Mr. Gatty from Belfast two Barrels of the different
  kindes of Timber tree seeds &c. but I doubt they will be too
  late excepting the Pines which seed will do when two year old.

  Your letter came a few days ago by an advice Ship of War,
  which superceeded My Lord Loudoun in the Command and General
  Abercrombie appointed in his place, with many other changes
  and promotions in our Military affairs in this Continent, how
  far they may change our Luck I shall not pretend to judge, but
  we have need of some sort of medicine for that end. We have a
  prospect of a very warm and vigorous campaign, and I hope it
  will be successful. Our Regiment is appointed for the Lewisburgh
  Expedition, but as we are so far up in the Country where the
  Generall is to have his department and opperations it is yet
  uncertain but he may keep us with him; we are all in very good
  health and compleat for service.

  I cannot yet know what remittance I can make for this year,
  some I will and shall, sometime before we take the field or the
  midle of May. To prevent a relaps of my last years companion I
  travelled to the Southard during the severity of the winter to N.
  York and Philadelfia &c. which have had the desyrd effect and I’m
  now as chois as ever, but it will not enlarge the remittance.

  I have had no letter from Sandy Campbell since Aprile last,
  Nor from Jesie since July, I received one from Mr. Richardson
  with yours which I shall answer by next Pacquett and tell him
  so with my compliments. Lykways please tell Peter Campbell that
  his letter came at the same time, and that as Adam Fisher is
  here I had are opportunity of enquiring about his son who is at
  present out as master, not Capt. of a Privateer there was no such
  prizes or Fortoune as Peter believed what may be now I know not
  but there is no great prospect of it. This is the only letter I
  write by the first Pacquett, so that you may communicate it to my
  friends as a proof of my being well and youll in the same course
  make my compliments to them all.

  I’m sorry that Captain Campbell should make objections to the
  payment of his Bill; he brought me 3 * * * for which I cleared
  him all his charge and gav * * * at that time 20 guineas over for
  his own trouble * * * expense this he knows and will appear by
  my * * * which you can see; * * * this indeed I thought suitable
  any expense he coud incur in Mull and that it * * * my power to
  give him or not the raising of an * * * rather than have any
  difference about it let h * * * what I had allowed me by the
  Regiment which was £3 per man for the first two years and two
  guineas for the remaining years that at a medium or the full as
  you please but I hope he’ll allow interest upon what Ballance
  may be due by him upon such an amot from the time it fell due
  April 46 when he went to the Regt.

      I am,
      My dear Sir,
      Your affect, humble servant.
      Dun. Campbell.

  To

  John Campbell of Cloichombie Esqr.
  Inveraray,
  North Brittain.

  (edge of letter torn off--hence gaps) (J.F.C.)

The letter bears the Inverawe arms on seal and is endorsed,
probably by the addressee “14th March 1758, from Inveraw concerning
his familie and affairs and Lieut. Collonel Dugd. Campbell’s Bill.”

This letter will bear reading and re-reading. The first and to the
writer the most important part of the letter was some financial
and family problem. Unfortunately his guarded and cryptic message
caused by the fear that the letter might be opened by another than
the addressee will perhaps leave it always an unsolved mystery. It
would be interesting to know what success attended the planting
of the two barrels of timber seed. His guess that the Black
Watch might be used in the Ticonderoga campaign rather than the
Lewisburgh as planned, proved correct. It would be interesting
to know what the malady of the previous winter was, to prevent a
relapse of which it had been necessary to travel to the Southard.
The letter closes with another financial problem. If he means that
he was allowed ten or fifteen dollars per man for the thousand men
in the Regiment, that would be a very sizable income for those days
and the bill must have been a large one. The allowance, however,
might have been for recruits secured or some other regimental
activity. But aside from the interesting contents of this letter
its real value is that it gives an opportunity to learn something
of the character of its writer. One can read between the lines that
Duncan of Inverawe was a reserved man of a strong but a quiet,
kindly nature, he would suffer loss himself rather than make
trouble for others, and after having done his best was willing to
take whatever came without complaint. It quite matches the Inverawe
of the ghost story who promised to protect a fugitive and then
stood by his oath even though the refugee was the murderer of
his cousin. The reader of this letter can not help but feel drawn
towards its writer.

[Illustration: The Black Watch of Canada at the dedication of the
Black Watch Memorial Tablet July 8, 1925, the inscription of which
reads:

  A. D. 1925. The Saint Andrews Society of Glens Falls, N. Y.,
  erected this tablet to commemorate the heroic gallantry of the
  42nd Regiment of Foot, better known as “The Royal Highlanders” or
  “THE BLACK WATCH” who on July 8, 1758, lost here in killed and
  wounded over six hundred of the thousand men engaged. Mortally
  wounded on that day was their Major, DUNCAN CAMPBELL OF INVERAWE,
  the hero of one of the most noted ghost stories of Scottish
  history and of Robert Louis Stevenson’s poem, “Ticonderoga.”]

Now what was the immediate family and what was the background of
our hero. One version of the ghost story was that he made his will
the night before the battle, but no sensible man waits until death
is at the door for this very important transaction and we find the
following in Vol. XV, Abstract of Entry in Sheriff Court Books of
Argyll at Inveraray.

  “Disposition by Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe to Lieut.
  Dugald Campbell, his eldest son procreated between him and Mrs.
  Jean Campbell, his wife, whom, failing, to Lieut. Alexander
  Campbell, his second son, whom failing, Duncan Campbell, his
  third and youngest son, whom failing, to any other sons he may
  lawfully have, and the heirs male of their bodies in succession,
  whom failing, to Janet Campbell, his only daughter now in life
  procreated between him and the said Mrs. Jean Campbell, of his
  whole lands and estate of Inverawe and others, under certain
  reservations; dated at Glasgow 17th April, 1756; witnesses, John
  Campbell of Cloichombie, Alexander Campbell in Achalion, and
  others.”

This establishes Inverawe’s family and we will see what became of
them. Dugald was appointed 2nd Lieutenant in the 21st or Royal
North British Fuziliers, December 28, 1755, joined his Regiment at
Gibraltar in 1756, died and was succeeded by John Wallace, March
1st, 1758.

Alexander was appointed Lieutenant in the Black Watch Jan. 28,
1756, was wounded at Ticonderoga and invalided to Glasgow where he
was promoted to a Captaincy in the Argyllshire Regiment of Fencible
men, July 21, 1759, died unmarried Feb. 8, 1760 and was buried in
Grey Friers Burying Ground. A powder horn said to have belonged
to Lt. Alexander and bearing the coat-of-arms of the Campbells of
Inverawe is at the McCord Museum of McGill University in Montreal.

Duncan, third son of Inverawe, is still a mystery but the fact that
Janet was proven heir to Inverawe February 5, 1762 would seem to
show that he had died without issue before that date.

Major Duncan, born Nov. 22, 1702, married March 20, 1732 Jean,
daughter of Col. Alexander Campbell of Finab. She died at
Edinburgh August 20, 1761. When Janet succeeded to Inverawe in
1762 therefore her father, her mother and three brothers had all
predeceased her--a tragic mortality in six short years. There is
a family tradition that Major Duncan mortgaged Inverawe to his
brother-in-law, Col. Robert Campbell of Finab and Monzie and that
according to old Scottish law the property was handed over to
the man who advanced the money until the rental had paid off the
debt, and that this arrangement was called a wadset. Whether Col.
Campbell of Finab and Monzie acquired the property by wadset or
purchase, it passed into his hands soon after Janet proved her
title and it is said that when she left the estate she washed her
hands in a bottle of wine at the border, which we were told was an
old Highland custom. The owner of Inverawe in 1910 was a descendant
of Col. Robert Campbell of Finab and Monzie, a Mrs. Campbell of
Dunstaffnage. Since then we are informed it was purchased by the
late Mr. James Currie and is now for sale to settle his estate.

Janet who married Capt. William Pitman, had only one daughter,
Susan, who died unmarried. So with her the descendants of Major
Duncan Campbell of Inverawe are at an end.

There is a very interesting tale about an Inverawe cup. It seems
that in 1714 the three brothers, Archibald of Inverawe, Dugald of
Shirvan, and Alexander of Kilmartin, each got a silver cup. The
Kilmartins always kept their cup but both those of Inverawe and
Shirvan were lost. This was such a grief to the Inverawes that
the fact was often mentioned. On one occasion a friend who had
heard of this cup was hunting in Ireland and stopped at a wretched
little inn to get a drink for himself and his horse. The place was
so disreputable looking that he would not go in but had his drink
brought out to him. It came in a battered old metal cup and on the
chance that it might be of value, he bought it from the landlord.
To his great pleasure he found on having it cleaned that it was the
long lost Inverawe cup. He had an inscription put on it, recording
the finding, and sent it to Archibald Campbell of Blackhouse, a
nephew of Major Duncan, and the representative at that time of
the Inverawe family. The cup is still a treasured possession of
the descendants of this Archibald, the Campbells of Arduaine,
Lochgilphead.

[Illustration: --From “Auchindarroch Miscellany”

THE INVERAWE CUP]

The will of the Archibald of Inverawe of the Silver Cup and father
of Major Duncan Campbell, is as follows:

  “1727, February 23rd--Disposition by Archibald Campbell of
  Inveraw to Duncan Campbell, his eldest lawful son, and the heirs
  male of his body, whom failing, to Dugall Campbell, his second
  lawful son, and his heirs male, whom failing, Lachlan Campbell,
  his third son, and Alexander Campbell, his fourth son, whom all
  failing, the heirs of the Granter and Janet McLean, his spouse,
  whom failing, his heirs of any other marriage of his lands of
  Inveraw, Drumchoise, Dalneass, etc., with certain exceptions,
  including a life rent right granted by the deceased Archibald
  Campbell of Inveraw to Lilias Campbell, his spouse, now spouse
  to Angus Campbell of Dunstagnage; dated at Inveraw 14th February
  1722.”

Another interesting fact in the Inverawe annals is that Dugald
Campbell of London in the parish of Saint Martin’s, Westminster,
and County of Middlesex, by his will bearing date the 2nd day of
June 1718, gave to old decayed men and young women of Campbell of
Inverawe’s family, the sum of £300, and that this “Inverawe Annuity
Fund” since augmented, is still administered by Trustees chosen
from the Inverawe heirs.

The present known Campbells who are proud to claim that they are of
the Clan Inverawe are descended from Alexander, brother of Duncan,
the fourth son of Archibald, as named in the foregoing will.
Alexander was born in 1710 and married Ann Somerville in 1747. If
all of the descendants of this union have been of as fine, high
character as those whom we have been privileged to meet, the world
has indeed been richer for the Campbells of Inverawe.


_Family Tree of The Campbells of Inverawe_

The family does not seem to be entirely in agreement on the line
back of the 18th Century. The following is gathered from different
branches. One version is that the Inverawes descended from Sir
Archibald Campbell of Lochow, whose son Colin was knighted by
Alexander III, 1280, and died 1294. His son, Niel or Nigel of
Lochow, died 1360, and _his_ son, Dugald or Duncan was the 1st
“Inverawe” and ancestor of the Clan Dhonnachie Campbells. He got a
grant of the estate of Inveraw and Cruachan from David II, 1330.
A later Inveraw got a grant of lands from Queen Mary, 1558. With
the exception of a gap of about 60 years from 1460 or so to 1510,
we have a complete record of “Inveraws” practically an unbroken
succession from father to son.

Another version is the following:

  Archibald, c/v from 1st Earl of Argyll

  Dougal, c/v 22.11.1485, from 2nd Earl. Sasine Des. 1486. Officer
  of Over Lochow to the Earl. (Inverawe deeds)

  Archibald, signs Archibald McCoul McConachie of Inverawe 1519,
  (Thanes of Cawdor), c/v from 2nd Earl as heir to Dugal (Inverawe
  deeds) married Margaret Campbell.

  Dougal, (Inverawe 1548-1562). (Register of Decreets and Acts)
  said to have married a dau. of Lochnell.

  Archibald, (1562-1567 or 1576) married Margaret C. dau. of Dougal
  C. of Ardcullour, sister of Sir James C. VIth of Ardkinklas. (A.
  Charters)

  Dougal, (1576 or 1567-1583) married Christian Carswell, dau. (or
  granddaughter) of Bishop Carswell. Relict of Dougal 1587. She
  afterward married Neill Campbell, Bishop of Lismore.

  Archibald, (1583-1650)

  Dougal, (1650-1674), burned “Bonnie House of Airlie” 1640.
  married 1st, Agnes, dau. of Sir Robert C. of Glenarguhy
  (Braedalbane) 2nd, Janet, dau. of Rory McNeill of Barra.

  Archibald, (1674-1705), son of Dougal and Agnes. Married 1st,
  Mary, dau. of Hector McNeill of Thayneis. 2nd, Lilias, dau. of
  Sir James C. of Lawers.

  Archibald, (1705-1730) married Janet McLean of Torloisk. Served
  heir to Cattinis 1700, later Inverawe, etc. Received Inverawe cup
  1714.

  Duncan (1730-1758), Major Black Watch, married Jane Campbell of
  Finab.

COMPARISON OF LOSSES OF BLACK WATCH AT TICONDEROGA WITH THOSE OF
OTHER WARS.

In the “Regimental Losses in the American Civil War, 1861, 1865.
A treatise in the extent and nature of the mortuary losses in the
Union Regiments, with full and exhaustive statistics compiled from
the official records on file on the State Military Bureaus and at
Washington, by William F. Fox, Lieut. Col. U. S. V., president of
the Society of the 12th Army Corps; late president of the 107th
New York Veteran Volunteer Association. Albany Publishing Company,
Albany, N. Y., 1899.” The writer states that he has examined the
records of 2,000 regiments of the Union Army and on page 2 he
says, “The one regiment in all the Union Army which sustained the
greatest loss in battle during the American Civil War was the 5th
New Hampshire Infantry. It lost 295 men, killed or mortally wounded
in action during the four years of service from 1861 to 1865. It
served in the first division, second corps. This division was
commanded successively by General Richardson, Hancock, Caldwall,
Barlow and Miles and any regiment that followed the fortunes of
these men was sure to find plenty of bloody work cut out for it.
Its loss includes 18 officers killed, a number far in excess of the
usual proportions and indicates that the men were bravely led.”

“There were 34 regiments of the Union Army whose casualties in
killed, wounded or missing amounted to 58 per cent or over of
the men engaged in one battle in each case, however, there was
not a full regiment engaged. For example, the 1st Minnesota at
Gettysburg, which was the highest per centage, had 47 killed and
168 wounded, or a total loss of 215 out of 262 men engaged. This is
a loss of 82 per cent.

The 9th Illinois at Shiloh had 61 killed, 300 wounded and 5
missing, a total of 63.3 per cent.

The Light Brigade which has been immortalized by Tennyson took 673
officers and men into that charge at Balaklava in which 113 were
killed and 134 wounded, a total of 247 or 36.7 per cent.

[Illustration: Lord Howe’s Monument in Westminster Abbey

THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETS BAY, IN NEW ENGLAND BY AN ORDER OF
THE GREAT AND GENERAL COURT BEARING DATE FEB^Y 1^{ST} 1759, CAUSED
THIS MONUMENT TO BE ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE AUGUSTUS
LORD VISCOUNT HOWE, BRIGADIER GENERAL OF HIS MAJESTY’S FORCES
IN AMERICA, WHO WAS SLAIN JULY THE 6^{TH} 1758, ON THE MARCH TO
TICONDEROGA, IN THE 34^{TH} YEAR OF HIS AGE: IN TESTIMONY OF THE
SENSE THEY HAD OF HIS SERVICES AND MILITARY VIRTUES, AND OF THE
AFFECTION THEIR OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS BORE TO HIS COMMAND.

HE LIVED RESPECTED AND BELOVED: THE PUBLICK REGRETTED HIS LOSS; TO
HIS FAMILY IT IS IRREPARABLE.]

The heaviest loss in the German army of the Franco-Prussian war
was the 16th Infantry (3d Westphalian) at Mars LaTour which had
509 killed, 619 wounded, 365 missing, a total of 1,484 or 49.4 per
cent. out of 3,000 men. The regiments of the German army had 3,000
men.”

The above are the greatest casualties suffered in three great wars
taken from a book compiled by an authority who had made a study
of the subject. Compare with these the loss of the Black Watch
at Ticonderoga given by Col. Stewart of Garth as 8 officers, 9
sergeants and 297 men killed and 17 officers, 10 sergeants and
306 soldiers wounded or a casualty of 647 (64.7 per cent) out of
the 1,000 men of the 42nd reported by General Abercrombie at Lake
George, June 29, 1758.

BRITISH REGIMENTS AT TICONDEROGA, 1758.

_With Notes From Farmer’s Regimental Records._


27th.

1751-1881, The 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot. Also 1758
“Lord Blakeney’s.”

1881 (from) First Battalion “The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.”

Nickname--“The Lumps.”

      Notes.--Formed from three Companies of the Inniskilling
      forces. It is unique in using the old Irish war-pipes. While
      employed on the Isthmus of Darien all but nine of six hundred
      men succumbed. For distinguished gallantry at St. Lucia, in
      1696, it was directed that the French garrison in marching
      out should lay down their arms to the 27th, other marks of
      favor being likewise accorded to the officers and men of the
      regiment.


42nd.

1749-58, 42nd Regiment of Foot (The Highland Regiment).

1758-1861, 42nd (or Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot. Also “Lord
John Murray’s,” 1758 and 59.

1881 (from) 1st Battalion The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).

Regimental Badges-“The Royal Cypher within the Garter.” The badge
and motto of the Order of the Thistle. Also (in each of the four
corners) the Royal Cypher ensigned with the Imperial Crown. Also
“The Sphinx” (for Egypt, 1801).

      Notes.--The 1st Battalion of this famous corps, the oldest
      Highland regiment in the British army, was raised from six
      Independent companies of Highlanders. Its sombre dress of
      black, blue, and green tartan gave rise to its popular name.
      To enumerate its services is simply to narrate the military
      history of Great Britain since the early part of the last
      century. Hardly a campaign has been conducted, or a battle
      fought, in which the Black Watch--one battalion or the
      other, or both in company--has not participated; always with
      bravery, and frequently with conspicuous gallantry. Thereto
      its records of services abundantly testifies. At Fontenoy,
      Ticonderoga, and at Bushy Run “extraordinary and unexampled”
      gallantry was shown. It received Royal distinction in its
      change of title in 1758, and was privileged to wear the red
      heckle in the bonnet, in recognition of its conduct at the
      battle of Guildermalsen in 1795. In Egypt (in 1801, for which
      it bears “The Sphinx”), before Alexandria, it captured the
      Standard of the French Invincible Legion. Since then it has
      heaped fame on fame, and added “honor” to “honor” to its
      colours. Nor has the 2nd Battalion (raised in Perthshire in
      1758 as the second Battalion of the 42nd, but, renumbered,
      long known as the 73rd prior to the territorial restoration
      of the ancient status) failed to win fresh laurels as
      occasion arose. At Mangalore (1783) against Tippoo Sahib, and
      side by side with the senior Battalion at Waterloo, in the
      Netherlands, in the Indian Mutiny, and in the Kaffir wars of
      1846-53, it has worthily sustained the undying fame of the
      regiment. Recent events in South Africa show that neither
      the officers nor the men of today have lost one iota of
      that traditional dash, determination, and the bravery which
      have won for the Black Watch so glorious a place in British
      military annals.


44th.

1751-82, The 44th Regiment of Foot. Also 1758, “General
Abercrombie’s.”

1881 (from) The First Battalion “The Essex Regiment.”

Nicknames--“The Two Fours” (of the 44th). “The Little Fighting
Fours,” (the regiment saw hard service in the Peninsula, and its
men were of small average stature). “The Pompadours” and “Saucy
Pompeys.” (Tradition relates that when the facings were changed in
1764 (the crimson not wearing well) the Colonel desired Blue, but
the authorities objecting, he chose Purple, a favorite color of
Madame de Pompadour, a mistress of Louis XV, of France).

      Notes.--The 44th captured an Eagle of the 62nd French
      Infantry at Salamanica.


46th.

1751-82, The 46th Regiment of Foot. Also 1758 “Lieut. Gen. Thomas
Murray’s.”

1881 (from) Second Battalion “Duke of Cornwall’s Light infantry.”

Nicknames--These pertain to the late 46th; “Murray’s Buck’s” (from
Colonel name (1743-64) and its smart appearance on home duty
in Scottish Royal livery). “The Surprisers” (from an incident
(1777) in the American War). “The Lacedemonians” (its Colonel
once when under fire, made a disciplinarian speech concerning the
Lacedemonians). Also in early days, “The Edinburgh Regiment.” “The
Red Feathers.” “The Docs” (the initials).

      Note.--“The Two Feathers” is a distinction of the 46th, a
      Light company of which, in 1777, with others were brigaded as
      “The Light Battalion.” The Americans were so harrassed by the
      Brigade that they vowed “No Quarter.” In derision, to prevent
      mistakes, the Light Battalion dyed their feathers red; the
      46th Foot alone has retained the distinction.


55th

1757-82, The 55th Regiment of Foot. Also “Lord Howe’s” in 1858 and
“Prideaux’s” in 1759.

1881 (from) Second Battalion “The Border Regiment.”

Nickname--“The Two Fives” (to the 55th for its number).

      Notes.--The Dragon of China is on the Regimental Badge of the
      55th in honor of the victorious campaign in China in 1840-42.


1st and 4th Battalions 60th.

1755-57, The 62nd (Royal American) Regiment of Foot; renumbered.

1757-1824, The 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot.

1881 (from) Second Battalion “The Border Regiment.”

      Notes.--This regiment, though possessing no “Colors,” bears
      more honors than any other regiment, the Highland Light
      Infantry coming next with twenty-nine. Motto, “Swift and
      Bold,” bestowed according to tradition by General Wolfe in
      recognition of its conduct at Quebec.


80th.

1758-64, The 80th (Light-armed) Regiment of Foot. Also “Gage’s.”
(Disbanded 1764).


The Royal Regiment of Artillery.

One arm or other of this branch of the Service has, obviously,
taken part in every campaign; a particularized list is therefore
unnecessary. The guns are the “Colours” of the Artillery, and as
such are entitled to all “parade honours.” Formerly, regimental
honors appear to have been worn by certain companies. Amongst such
are “Niagara,” “Leipsic,” “Waterloo,” and “The Dragon of China.”

Nicknames--“The Gunners;” “The Four-wheeled Hussars” (of the Royal
Horse Artillery).

      Notes.--Trains of artillery seem to have been raised in the
      time of Henry VIII., and up to 1716 appear to have been
      disbanded after each campaign. In 1716 several companies
      received permanent corporate existence, since which
      exigencies of modern warfare have led to an enormous increase
      in the number of batteries. But from first to last, the
      record of the Royal Artillery has been one of distinction,
      and it may fitly be said to share the honors of all other
      regiments. The Royal Irish Artillery were absorbed in 1801,
      and the East India Company’s Artillery in 1858.


BRITISH REGIMENTS AT TICONDEROGA, 1759.

1st.

1751-1812, The 1st, or The Royal Regiment of Foot, also the
“Royals.”

1881 (from) The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment).

Nickname--“Pontius Pilate’s Body-Guard.” It is a legend of the
Regiment that the Romans carried off a number of wild, war-like
Highlanders as prisoners after their conquest of Britain, and these
men and their descendants became soldiers of the Roman Empire and
as such they guarded the tomb of Our Saviour after the crucifixion.
This Scottish company, for it only consisted of one hundred men
under a centurion, was kept distinct from the Roman Army proper. At
the time of the crucifixion they were called Pontius Pilate’s Scots
Guards, and their descendants were the nucleus of the First Royal
Scots in later years.

      Notes.--The oldest Regiment of Foot in the British Army.
      Traditionally regarded as the ancient body-guard of the
      Scottish kings, this famous corps was in the service of
      Sweden, as “Hepburn’s Regiment,” from 1625 to 1633; and in
      that of France from 1633 to 1678, when (under Dumbarton) it
      came to England. It received its title in 1684 in recognition
      of the capture of a Colour from the Moors at Tangier. At
      Sedgemoor (1685) it also captured the Duke of Monmouth’s
      Standard.


17th.

1751-82, The 17th Regiment of Foot. Also “Forbes.”

1881 (from) “The Leicestershire Regiment.”

Nicknames--“The Bengal Tigers” (from its badge); “The Lily-whites”
(from its facings).

      Notes.--Mainly raised near London; twelve regiments in all
      were formed in 1688, but this and the 16th (The Bedfordshire)
      are alone in commission now.

PROVINCIAL REGIMENTS AT TICONDEROGA.

(The writer will have to admit that this list is more or less
incomplete, even the N. Y. State Library at Albany had only
scattered items. It would seem as if this would be a good subject
for an article for some future meeting of the Association and any
information will be gratefully received).


1758.

The New York Colonial Manuscripts, edited by Callaghan, page 732,
in the list of regiments having officers wounded at the battle of
July 8, 1758, gives the following regiments: Col. DeLancey’s, New
York; Col. Babcock’s, Rhode Island; Col. Fitche’s, Connecticut;
Col. Worcester’s, Connecticut; Col. Bagley’s, Massachusetts; Col.
Partridge’s, Massachusetts; Col. Preble’s, Massachusetts; Col.
Johnston’s, New Jersey. Parkman mentions Col. Bradstreet with his
regiment of boatmen, armed and drilled as soldiers and it is also
certain that Roger’s Rangers were with the expedition.

The year book of the Maine Chapter of the Society of Colonial
Wars for 1900 gives much information in regard to Col. Preble’s
regiment, Maine being in 1758 a part of Massachusetts. Mention is
made in this article of regiments officered by “Col. Doty, Col.
Joseph Williams, Col. Nickols, Col. Whitings.”

Also in the New York Colonial Manuscripts, Vol. 10, P. 827 it
mentions a force of about 3,000 men nearly all of whom were
provincials, under Col. Bradstreet, in the expedition against Fort
Frontinac after the battle of July 8, 1758, and of the number of
soldiers engaged, the list is given as “New Yorkers 1112, Col.
Williams’ regiment 413, Col. Douty’s 248, Rhode Island 318, and
Jersey 418.”

It is not clear whether these regiments were at the battle of
Ticonderoga and were not mentioned in list page 732 of the New York
Colonial Manuscripts because none of the officers were wounded, or
whether they were the same regiments but with different officers, a
change having been made after the battle.


1759

The provincial regiments mentioned in Commissary Wilson’s Orderly
Book as being in the Ticonderoga expedition of 1759 are as
follows: Col. Lyman’s, Connecticut; Col. Whiting’s, Connecticut;
Col. Worcester’s, Connecticut; Col. Fitch’s, Connecticut; Col.
Willard’s, Massachusetts; Col. Ruggle’s, Massachusetts; Col.
Lovell’s, New Hampshire; Col. Schuyler’s, New Jersey; Col.
Babcock’s, Rhode Island.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF AS MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF 1758 AS COULD
BE TRACED.

_James Abercrombie._

James Abercrombie was promoted to a captaincy in the 42nd or 1st
Battalion of the Royal Highlanders on the 16th of February, 1756.
On the 5th of May, 1759, he was appointed aide de camp to Maj. Gen.
Amherst, with whom he made the campaigns of that and the following
year. On the 25th of July, 1760, he was appointed Major of the 78th
or Fraser’s Highlanders and in September following was employed
by Gen. Amherst in communicating to the Marquis de Vaudreuil
the conditions preparatory to the surrender of Montreal and in
obtaining the signature of that governor to them. (Knox’s Journal).
The 78th having been disbanded in 1763, Major Abercrombie retired
on half pay. On the 27th of March, 1770, he again entered active
service as Lt. Colonel of the 22nd Regiment then serving in America
under the command of Lt. Col. Gage and was killed in the memorable
Battle of Bunker Hill on the 17th of June, 1775.

      Co., Albany, 1856, page 160.


_Hugh Arnot._

Hugh Arnot was taken from the half pay list and appointed a
Lieutenant in the 42nd Highlanders, 9th April, 1756, at the
augmentation of that Regiment on its coming to America, and was
promoted to a Company on the 27th December, 1757. He served in the
unfortunate affair of Ticonderoga in 1758, and in 1759 accompanied
Amherst as above. On the 16th August, 1760, he exchanged into the
46th Foot, in which Regiment he continued to serve until 1769, when
his name was dropped from the Army List.

_Patrick Balneaves._

Patrick Balneaves, of Edradour, entered the 42nd, as Ensign, 28th
January, 1756, and was promoted to be Lieutenant 1st April, 1758;
he was wounded at Ticonderoga, 1758; and again at Martinico in
1762; became Captain-Lieutenant 23rd August, 1763, and left the
army in 1770.

_Allan Campbell._

Allan Campbell, son of Barcaldine, entered the Army as Ensign of
the 43d (now the 42nd) Highlanders, Dec. 25, 1744, and served that
year against the Pretender. Was made prisoner of war at Preston
Pans, 21st Sept. 1745 and sent on parole to Perth. Was appointed
lieutenant Dec. 1, 1746. He obtained a Company 13th of May, 1755,
and the next year came to America, where he shared the difficulties
and honors of the Regiment. In June, 1759, he was appointed Major
for the campaign under Amherst, and was actively employed at the
Head of the Grenadiers and Rangers, clearing the way for the army
up the Lakes. He became major in the army 15th August, 1762,
and went on half-pay on the reduction of the regiment in 1763,
having obtained a grant of 5,000 acres of land at Crown Point. He
served 19 years in the regiment. In 1770, he was appointed Major
of the 36th or Herefordshire Foot, then serving in Jamaica;
became Lieutenant-Colonel in the army in May (1772), and of his
regiment in January, 1778; Colonel in the Army, 17th Nov. 1780;
Major-General in 1787; and died 1795. His Regiment did not serve in
America during the Revolutionary War.

An extract from his will dated 2nd March 1787, reads:

  “And whereas I am under a grant from the Crown intitled to a
  considerable tract of land and heredits situate, lying and being
  in the Province of New York in the County of Albany in America,
  between Ticonderoga and Crown Point. * * * I do hereby give,
  devise and bequeath unto my two sisters, Isabella Campbell,
  (wife of John C. of Archalader, in the Shire of Perth, in North
  Britain, aforesaid Esquire), and Jane Campbell of Edinchip,
  in the Shire of Perth, aforesaid, widow of Colin Campbell of
  Edinchip, aforesaid, Esq. deceased, their heirs, executors,
  Administrates, and Assigns, all my said track of land and
  heredits, in America,” etc.

_Archibald Campbell._

Archibald Campbell. Born 1720. Eldest son of Duncan Campbell of
Glendaruel and Lockhead. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of the
Rev. Archibald Campbell of Inverary. He was appointed Ensign 42d
Regt. 23d Jan. 1756, Lieut. 28th July 1757, Captain 4th Dec. 1759.
Died 3d June 1762.


_Donald Campbell._

Donald Campbell, son of Donald Campbell Bailie of McKairn, Taynuilt
Argyll, was appointed Ensign in the 42d Regt. of Foot, 5th May
1756. He was with one of the additional companies in the “Anandall”
which sprang two leaks, lost her mizen mast, was attacked three
times by Privateers (which they beat off with small arms), and was
driven into the West Indies, so that she did not arrive in New
York, in time for the company to join the attack on Ticonderoga.
He was appointed Lieut. 24th July 1758 and retired 13th June 1761,
having served with the Royal Highlanders from 1758 to 1761.

      Documents, page 629.


_Duncan Campbell (Killochronan, Island of Mull)._

Extract from the Memorial of Captain Duncan Campbell, American
Loyalist Claims.

  “Humbly Sheweth, that he was a native of Great Britain and he
  was appointed Ensign in the 42nd Highlanders 26 January 1756,
  in which Corps he served the war before last in America and the
  West Indies. And in August 1763 the Regiment was ordered on an
  expedition to the relief of Fort Pitt, then invested by the
  savages.

  On the march he was severely wounded at the battle of Bushy
  Run, and for a long time rendered unfit for service. (In this
  skirmishing warfare the troops suffered much from the want of
  water and the extreme heat of the weather) which occasioned his
  retiring on half pay in 1764.

  He soon thereafter settled at Fredricksburg, Dutchess Co. in the
  Prov. of New York (in 1769) and purchased a valuable track of
  land from Colonel Beverly Robinson and others on good terms. In
  1775 he was Colonel of Militia and Magistrate for the said county.

  That at the commencement of the troubles he took an early and
  decided part in favor of His Majesty’s government, which rendered
  him so obnoxious to the popular party where he dwelt that he was
  obliged to fly to New York, to save his life, from the family and
  abandon his property in June 1775. That soon after his arrival
  there he engaged as an officer in the 2nd Battalion Highland
  Emigrant’s in which he continued doing duty until the cessation
  of hostilities, and consequent reduction of the Regiment in Nova
  Scotia, in which Province he now dwells. (2 January 1784).

  That early in June 1775 he got on board the Asia ship of war (64
  gun frigate) then stationed in New York and soon after was joined
  by some recruits he had engaged to follow him. In July thereafter
  he went to Boston where Gen. Gage then Commander-in-Chief,
  gave him command of an armed transport in which he returned to
  New York where he enlisted and received on board about 60 more
  recruits. That in September he returned again to Boston where
  he left all his recruits except 26 which were left on board as
  Marines, on the 8 October he was sent back on the same service.
  But on the 16 of the same month was unfortunately shipwrecked on
  the coast of New Jersey.

  On this service he lost all his money and baggage to the
  amount of £100. This loss His Excellency Sir William Howe,
  then Commander-in-Chief, would not think of reimbursing at the
  time. In consequence of the shipwreck he and his party had the
  misfortune to be made prisoners and was carried to Philadelphia
  where he was fourteen months in a small apartment of the dismal
  gaol where he contracted a sickness which was likely to prove
  fatal to him.

  How soon he was taken his family were turned out of doors and
  deprived of everything they had except some wearing apparell. The
  distressed situation of the family so driven from their home may
  be easier felt than described. It brought on for a beginning the
  untimely death of an amiable wife, and deprived his five infant
  children of a mother’s care whereby they for some time became
  objects of compassion which he was unable to rescue them from.
  Until he was exchanged and joined his Regiment (in January 1777)
  he thereafter continued to serve during the war.

  N. B. The Memorialist was appointed Second Oldest Captain in
  the 2nd Batt. 84th Regiment the 14 June 1775 and was reduced in
  October 1783 without a step of preferment in the Regt. or in the
  Line.

  Captain 4th Breadalbane Regt. of Fencibles 2nd Batt. 1 March
  1793; Major 17 Feb. 1794; Lieut. Col. 9 Dec. 1795; Regiment
  disbanded 18 April 1799. He died at Edinburgh in Dec. 1799.”

_John Campbell of Duneavis._

John Campbell, of Duneaves, Perthshire, was originally a private in
the Black Watch. In 1743, he was presented, with Gregor McGregor,
to George II, as a specimen of the Highland soldier and performed
at St. James the broadsword exercise and that of the Lochaber axe,
before his Majesty and a number of General officers. Each got a
gratuity of a guinea, which they gave to the porter at the gate of
the palace as they passed out. Mr. Campbell obtained an Ensigncy in
1745 for his bravery at the battle of Fontenoy; was promoted to be
Captain-Lieutenant, 16th February, 1756, and landed in New York the
following June. He was among the few resolute men who forced their
way into the work at Ticonderoga, on the 8th of July, where he was
killed.


_John Campbell of Glendaruel._

John Campbell of Glendaruel, born in 1721, was appointed Ensign
of the 42nd Regt. of Foot 25th Sept., 1745; Lieutenant 16th May,
1748; Captain Lieut. 2nd July 1759; and Captain 20th July 1760;
Captain 27th or Inniskilling Regiment of Foot 25th March 1762;
Major Supt. of Indian Affairs in the Province of Quebec 2nd July,
1773; Lieut. Col. of Indian Affairs 29th August 1777; and Colonel
16th Nov. 1790.

He married Marianna St. Lucan (date not given) and died Montreal,
23rd June 1795.

“In the course of a long and meritorious service with his Regiment,
the 42nd Highlanders, in all its campaigns from the Rebellion in
1745 to the attack on Ticonderoga, where he was wounded on the 8th
July, 1758, and the conquest of Canada, Martinique, and Havanna.
He subsequently served in the expedition commanded by General
Burgoyne, at the head of a number of Indians, and was distinguished
for his spirited conduct as an officer, adorned by that elegance
and politeness which mark the accomplished gentleman and his
virtues in private life endeared him to his family and companions.

His remains were attended to the grave in a manner suitable to
his rank. Not only by a very numerous assembly of citizens of all
ranks, but by a large body of Indian warriors, whose very decent
behavior evinced the sincerity with which they partook of the
universal regret occasioned by the loss of so very respectable a
member of society.”

      Major Sir Duncan Campbell of Barcaldine, Bart. C. V. O.


_John Campbell of Strachur._

John Campbell of Strachur, in the Highlands of Scotland, entered
the Army in June, 1745, as Lieutenant of Loudon’s Highlanders;
served through the Scotch Rebellion; made the Campaign in Flanders,
1747, and was promoted to a company on the 1st October of that
year. At the peace of 1748, he went on Half-Pay and so remained
until the 9th April, 1756, when he was appointed to the 42nd
Highlanders previous to the embarcation of that Regiment for
America. He was wounded in the attack on Ticonderoga in 1758, and
was appointed by General Amherst Major of the 17th Foot on the 11th
July, 1759; was promoted to be Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army, 1st
February, 1762 and commanded his Regiment in the expedition that
year against Martinico and Havana. On the 1st May, 1773, he became
Lieutenant-Colonel of the 57th or West Middlesex Foot, returned
to America in 1776 with his Regiment at the breaking out of the
Revolution; was appointed Maj. General 19th February, 1779, Colonel
of his Regiment 2d November, 1780, and commanded the British Forces
in West Florida, where after a gallant though ineffectual defence
he was obliged to surrender Pensacola to the Spaniards 10th May,
1781. He became Lieutenant-General 28th September, 1787; General in
the Army, 26th January, 1797, and died in the fore part of 1806.

_Gordon Graham._

Gordon Graham of Drainie in the Highlands of Scotland, was
appointed ensign in the 43rd Highlanders in Oct. 25, 1739, and
was made lieutenant June 24, 1743. He served in Flanders and
shared in the defeat at Fontenoy in 1745, after which the Regiment
returned home. In 1747 he made another campaign in Flanders. On
August 7, 1747, he was appointed captain. In 1749 the number of
the regiment was changed to the 42d and Mr. Graham obtained a
company in it 3d June, 1752, came to America in 1756, was at the
surrender of Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro in 1757, and
was wounded at Ticonderoga in 1758. The Major of the Regiment
having been killed on that occasion Captain Graham succeeded to the
vacancy, July 17th, 1758, and made the campaign of 1759 and 1760
under Amherst. He next served in the West Indies in the expedition
against Martinique and July 9, 1762, became Lieutenant Colonel of
the Regiment, which returned to New York, and in the year 1763,
proceeded to the relief of Fort Pitt, defeating the Indians on the
way in the Battle of Bushy Run. In December, 1770, he retired after
31 years of service in the Regiment. As his name does not appear in
the army list of 1771 it is presumed that he died at this time.

Ticonderoga in 1758; was again wounded at the battle of Bushy Run,
near Pittsburg, in 1763; served in the subsequent campaigns against
the Indians, and embarked for Ireland in 1767. He succeeded Major

_Francis Grant._

Francis Grant, son of the Laird of Grant, and brother of Sir
Ludovick Grant, of Grant, Scotland, was received from half-pay
in Loudon’s Regiment and was made ensign in the Black Watch Oct.
25, 1739. Nov. 5, 1739, he was made lieutenant; June 18, 1743,
captain; and Oct. 3, 1745, he became major. A vacancy occurring
in the lieutenant-colonelcy, in December, 1755, the men of the
Regiment subscribed a sum of money among themselves to purchase the
step for him, but it was not required; he had already obtained his
promotion. He accompanied the Regiment to America in 1756 and was
present at the bloody battle of Ticonderoga, July 8, 1758, where he
was wounded. In the following year he accompanied Amherst on his
expedition, and in 1760 was in command of the van of the Army from
Oswego to Montreal. In 1761 he commanded the Army sent to the south
to chastise the Cherokees. He served as Brigadier-General in the
expedition against Martinico in 1762, and on the 19th of February
of that year became colonel in the army. On July 9, 1762, after
twenty-three years of service in the Black Watch Regiment, he was
removed and appointed to the command of the 90th Light Infantry.
In August, 1762, he commanded the 4th Brigade at the siege of
Havana and went on half pay at the peace of 1763. In November,
1768, he became colonel of the 63rd; Major-General in 1770; and
Lieutenant-General in 1777. He died at the beginning of 1782 (Army
Lists).

_James Murray._

James Murray, second son of Lord George Murray, by his marriage
with Amelia Murray, heiress of Strowan and Glencarse, and grandson
of the first Duke of Atholl, was born at Tullibardine on the
19th of March, 1734, and it is interesting to know that Lord John
Murray, who was destined in after years to be his colonel, was
called upon to be his godfather. A commission as Lieutenant in the
Saxon Grenadier Guards was obtained for him in 1749, and he joined
his regiment in 1751. He served against the forces of Frederick
the Great until the Saxon Army capitulated at Pirna on the Elbe in
October, 1756. He was released on parole and returned to Scotland
in 1757 and on the nomination of his uncle, James Duke of Atholl,
was given a captain’s commission in the Black Watch and was placed
in command of one of the three additional companies then being
raised for service in America. He reached New York in April, 1758,
and commanded Captain Reid’s company in the unsuccessful attack on
Ticonderoga--his own company having been left in garrison at Fort
Edward. He was wounded but was soon able to return to duty and took
part in the successful expedition of 1759 to Lake Champlain. Toward
the close of that year he was given command--by Lord John Murray’s
desire--of the Grenadier Company of the newly-raised 2nd Battalion,
and with this battalion he served in the advance on Montreal in
1760 and in the capture of Martinique in 1762. He was wounded here
and invalided home and was on sick leave for more than six years.
He rejoined the Black Watch in 1768 and in 1769 was appointed
Captain-lieutenant in the 3rd Foot Guards, obtaining his promotion
as Captain and Lieutenant-colonel the following year. In 1772 he
was elected member of Parliament for Perthshire, a position which
he held for twenty-two years. He was appointed Governor of Upnor
Castle in 1775 and Fort William in 1780, but these were merely
nominal posts and did not interfere with his other duties. In 1776
he bought Strowan (originally the property of his mother), from his
nephew, the fourth Duke of Atholl.

On the outbreak of the War of Independence, Col. Murray offered
to raise a regiment of Highlanders for service in America, but
this offer was refused, and in March, 1777, he was sent out to
join the brigade of Guards under General Howe in New Jersey. He
was with Lord Cornwallis at Quibbletown and presumably took part
in the actions at Brandywine and Germantown in 1777. He spent the
following winter in quarters at Philadelphia, and left America in
the summer of 1778 and joined the Atholl Highlanders in Ireland
in September of that year, of which regiment he was given the
command. This regiment remained in Ireland during the war, at the
conclusion of which it was disbanded. James Murray was appointed
Lieutenant-colonel-commandant of the 78th Highlanders in 1783, but
as he was already a general officer he never did any duty with this
regiment. After 1783 General Murray resided a good deal at Strowan;
in 1786 he was promoted full Colonel of the 78th (by that time the
72nd), and in 1793 he was made Lieutenant-general. In March, 1794,
he felt himself obliged to resign his seat in Parliament owing to
ill health and a few days later--on the 19th of March--he died in
London and was buried in St. Margaret’s, Westminster.

Of Lord George Murray’s three sons, General James seems to have
been the one who most resembled his father. He had inherited the
Jacobite General’s sympathetic knowledge of Highland character,
something of his pride, and the same affectionate disposition. And
that he had at least a share of his father’s determination, and
presence of mind is shown by two anecdotes which have been handed
down with regard to him. One of these refers to his earlier days,
and is to the effect that, having been attacked by a highwayman one
night that he was driving over a heath near London, he leant out of
the window of the chaise, “groped in the dark for the ears of his
assailant’s horse,” and with the brief but expressive exclamation.
“Thereut’s-” fired a shot which ended the highwayman’s career. The
other relates that during the Gordon Riots of 1780 Colonel James
Murray was seated next Lord George Gordon in the House of Commons
at the very moment at which the mob threatened to break into the
House. Colonel Murray with a soldier’s instinct drew his sword,
pointed it at Lord George, and notwithstanding that he was his
cousin, declared his intention of running him through the body if
a single one of the rioters should enter. His promptness saved the
situation, but he had committed a breach of the privileges of the
House and was ordered to apologize on bended knee to the Speaker.
Colonel Murray made the required amende, but on rising from his
knee took out his handkerchief and dusted it, remarking, “Damned
Dirty House this; sooner it’s cleaned out the better.”

      Stewart of Garth gives the following in regard to General
      Murray’s wound, received at the capture of Martinique; (page
      126, Vol. 10.)

      “The musket ball entered his left side, under the lower rib,
      passed up through the left lobe of the lung, (as ascertained
      after his death) crossed his chest, and mounting up to his
      right shoulder, lodged under the scapula. His case being
      considered desperate, the only object of the surgeon was to
      make his situation as easy as possible for, the few hours
      they supposed he had to live; but, to the great surprise
      of all, he was on his legs in a few weeks, and, before he
      reached England, was quite recovered, or at least his health
      and appetite were restored. He was never afterwards, however,
      able to lie down; and during the thirty-two years of his
      subsequent life, he slept in an upright posture, supported in
      his bed by pillows.”


_Lord John Murray._

Lord John Murray, born on the 14th of April, 1711, was the eldest
son of John, first Duke of Atholl, by his second wife, the Hon.
Mary Ross, and half-brother to John, Marquess of Tullibardine, and
Lord George Murray. He became an ensign in the 3rd Foot Guards
(now the Scots Guards) in 1727, and a captain in the same regiment
in 1738. Immediately after the mutiny of the regiment in 1743 he
applied for the colonelcy in the 42nd or Black Watch, but he did
not obtain the appointment he so greatly desired until two years
later. In July, 1743, he was appointed first aide-de-camp to George
II and was in attendance on the King in Germany at the close of
the Dettingen campaign, but returned to England without having
taken part in any engagements. In April 1745, when at last gazetted
colonel of the Black Watch, he proceeded to join his regiment in
Flanders, but arrived too late for Fontenoy. He distinguished
himself, however, during the subsequent retreat of the British army
to Brussels, by his defence of a pass which the French attacked
by night. For this service he was publicly thanked by the Duke
of Cumberland. In 1745 he returned home with his regiment but in
1747 he was in the Netherlands taking part in the attempted relief
of Hulst. After the surrender of the town by the Dutch Governor,
Lord John commanded the rear-guard in the retreat to Welsharden,
and shortly afterwards, having been ordered to take part in the
defence of Bergen-op-Zoom, he was placed in command of the British
troops in the lines there. At the close of operations he received a
message of approbation from the King.

[Illustration: From “A Military History of Perthshire”

Lord John Murray, Colonel the Black Watch, 1745 to 1787]

In 1755 he was promoted major-general, and in 1758
lieutenant-general, but although he offered his services more than
once, he was not employed abroad during the Seven Years’ War. He
took the keenest interest, however, in all the exploits of his
regiment and worked hard to raise a second battalion in 1758.
Stewart of Garth tells us that when the men who had been disabled
at Ticonderoga appeared before the Board of Chelsea to claim their
pensions, Lord John went with them and explained their case in such
a manner to the commissioners that they were all successful. He
gave them money, got them a free passage to Perth, and offered a
house and garden to all who chose to settle on his estate. General
Stewart also describes how, when the 42nd at last returned from
America in 1767, Lord John, who had been for weeks at Cork awaiting
its arrival, marched into that town at its head.

Lord John was a great deal with the regiment while it was quartered
in Ireland, and, according to Stewart of Garth, was “ever attentive
to the interest of the officers and vigilant that their promotion
should not be interrupted by ministerial or other influence.” He
was also “unremitting in his exertions to procure the appointment
of good officers, and of officers who understood perfectly the
peculiar dispositions and character of the men.” For this reason he
strenuously endeavored to exclude all but the members of Scots--and
more especially Highland--families. He was equally particular that
only Gaelic-speaking men and Protestants should be recruited for
the ranks.

In spite of his military duties Lord John resided a good deal in
the country--and not only at the home of his boyhood--for early
in life he bought Pitnacree in Strathtay, and in later years he
had also a house in Perth. He represented Perthshire in Parliament
from 1734 to 1761. In 1758 he married Miss Dalton of Bannercross--a
Derbyshire heiress, by whom he had one daughter. In 1770 he became
a full general. His last military achievement was the raising in
1779 and 1780 (at his own expense) of another second battalion to
the 42nd. This battalion so distinguished itself in India that
in 1786 it was placed permanently on the establishment under the
title of the 73rd Regiment. The veteran to whose patriotism it owed
its existence died on the 26th day of May, 1787, at the age of
seventy-six, the senior officer in the Army.

Lord John made the most of such chances as occurred of
distinguishing himself in the field, but those opportunities were
small for he never served in any war but the Austrian Succession.
It is therefore as the Colonel of the Black Watch that his name
has survived--as a man who understood the Highland soldiers well
enough to wish to command them at a time when to many that might
have seemed a task of great difficulty--and who, having at last
obtained the post he desired, completely identified himself with
the interests of his men, and for upwards of half a century was the
“friend and supporter of every deserving officer and soldier in the
regiment.”

      Military History of Perthshire, page 382-384.


_John Reid._

John Reid was the eldest son of Alexander Robertson of Straloch,
but the head of the family had always been known as “Baron Reid”
and the General and his younger brother, Alexander (who was an
officer in the 42nd), adopted the more distinctive surname early
in life. He was born at Inverchroskie in Strathardle, on the 13th
of February, 1721, and received his early education at Perth.
Being destined for the law, he was afterwards sent to Edinburgh
University. Nature, however, had intended him for a soldier, and
in June, 1745, having recruited the necessary quota of men, he
obtained a commission as lieutenant in Loudon’s Highlanders. He was
taken prisoner at Prestonpans the following September, but when
released the following spring he rejoined his regiment and was able
to render important service to the Government. From 1747 to 1748 he
served in Flanders with Loudon’s Highlanders and took part in the
defence of Bergen-op-Zoom, but on the reduction of his regiment at
the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle he was placed on half-pay. In 1751 he
bought a captain-lieutenant’s commission in the Black Watch and in
1752 a commission as captain in the same regiment. Four years later
on the outbreak of the war with France, he sailed with his regiment
to America. He was not present at the first attack on Ticonderoga
as he had been left behind sick at Albany, and his company was
commanded in that desperate engagement by Captain James Murray.
In 1759, Reid, by that time a major, took part in the second
advance to Lake Champlain, which resulted in the surrender of Forts
Ticonderoga and Crown Point; and on him devolved the command of the
42nd during the greater part of the campaign of 1760 which ended
with the capture of Montreal and the expulsion of the French from
Canada.

Reid remained in America with the 42nd until Dec., 1761, when he
accompanied it to the West Indies. He served in the capture of
Martinique and at the storming of Morne Tortenson, on Jan. 24,
1762, was in command of the 1st Battalion of his regiment. His
battalion suffered heavy loss and he was wounded in two places, but
recovered in time to take part in the expedition against Havana of
that same year. After the surrender of Cuba he returned to America.
In 1764 Reid acted as second-in-command of Colonel Bouquet’s
arduous but successful expedition against the Indians on the Ohio
and Muskingum Rivers. In the following year we hear of him fitting
out an expedition which was to be sent to the Illinois country
under the command of Captain Thomas Stirling of the 42nd.

About 1760, Reid married an American lady of Scots descent, Susanna
Alexander, daughter of James Alexander, surveyor-general of New
York and New Jersey. She owned property on Otter Creek in what is
now the State of Vermont, which was added to and improved by her
husband with the result that at the end of ten years Reid owned
“about thirty-five thousand acres of very valuable land” near Crown
Point and had “obtained from the Governor and Council of New York a
warrant of survey for fifteen thousand more,” which he intended to
“erect” into a manor.

In 1767 the Royal Highland Regiment left America for Ireland and
Reid presumably accompanied it. In 1770 Reid retired on half-pay,
intending no doubt to settle down to the enjoyment and improvement
of his American estates. However, in 1772 his tenants were expelled
by the people of Bennington “on the pretence of having claim to
that country under the Government of New Hampshire, notwithstanding
that the King in Council had, ten years before, decreed Connecticut
River to be the Eastern Boundary of New York.” In 1775 war broke
out with the American colonists, and though his case finally came
before the Commissioners for American Claims, the only compensation
awarded him was a trifling allowance for mills he had erected and
for fees he had paid for surveys. In May, 1778 his father’s estate,
Straloch, passed under the hammer as he was unable to pay the
mortgages and his son could give him no help.

Notwithstanding that he was a comparatively poor man, in 1779-1780
Reid raised at his own expense a regiment of foot, of which he
was appointed colonel. This was called the 95th and was disbanded
in 1783. In 1781 Reid was promoted major-general, and in 1793 a
lieutenant-general. He was appointed colonel of the 88th Regiment
(Connaught Rangers) in November, 1794, and became a general in
1798. In 1803, when an invasion was hourly expected, Reid, in
response to an order that all general officers not employed on the
staff should transmit their addresses to the Adjutant-General,
wrote that though in the eighty-second years of his age “and very
deaf and infirm,” he was still ready to use his feeble arm in
defence of his country. He died in the Haymarket on the 6th of
February, 1807, and was buried in St. Margaret’s, Westminster.

The General would probably have had but little property to dispose
of at his death, had he not in 1796 succeeded to a valuable estate
of some four or five thousand acres in Nova Scotia, which was
left to him by his cousin, Gen. John Small, “as a mark of ...
respect ... and attachment to the preservation of his name and
representation for succeeding ages.” Reid’s daughter had made
a marriage of which he disapproved, she had no children, and
his only brother had died in 1762 during the siege of Havana.
It was probably these circumstances that induced him to realize
the property in Nova Scotia and at the time of his death he was
worth some £52,000. This entire fortune, went after the death of
his daughter, to the University of Edinburgh to found a musical
professorship. He also left directions that a concert should be
given annually on or about his birthday to commence with several
pieces of his own composition, among the first of which is that
of the “Garb of Old Gaul,” a composition written by Sir Charles
Erskine, but set to music by Reid while major of the 42nd, and
which has ever since been a regimental march.

Reid also composed several military marches and was esteemed the
best gentleman player on the German flute in England. It may
safely be predicted that as long as the University exists this old
Perthshire soldier of the 18th century will be remembered as one of
its benefactors.

_John Small._

John Small was the third son of Patrick Small, who married
Magdalen Robertson, sister of Alexander Robertson, the father of
General John Reid. Reid and Small were thus not only neighbors and
brother-officers, but first cousins, and were evidently on terms
of close friendship. Born in Strathardle, Atholl, Scotland, in
1730, Small, like many of his countrymen of that date, began his
military career with the Scots Brigade in Holland, being appointed
a 2nd lieutenant in the Earl of Drumlanrig’s Regiment when it was
raised for service of the States-General in 1747. How long he
remained abroad is unknown but it is probable that he returned to
England when the regiment was reduced in 1752. He did not, however,
obtain a commission in the British army until four years later,
when he was appointed lieutenant in the 42nd, just prior to its
departure for America. So far as is known, Small took part in all
the campaigns in which his regiment was engaged from 1756 to 1763.
He fought at Ticonderoga in 1758, served with General Amherst’s
successful expedition to Lake Champlain in the following year, and
took part in the operations which completed the conquest of Canada
in 1760. After the surrender of Montreal he was sent in charge of
French prisoners to New York, and we learn from a brother officer
that General Amherst had great confidence in him, and frequently
employed him “on particular services.” Two years later he served in
the capture of Martinique and Havana and obtained his promotion as
captain.

At the peace of 1763 Small was placed on half-pay, but, according
to General Stewart, he was almost immediately put on the full-pay
list of the North British Fusiliers (21st) and when in 1767 the
Black Watch left for Europe, most of the men of that regiment who
had volunteered to stay in America joined the Fusiliers in order to
serve under Small, who was “deservedly popular” with them. Small,
however, cannot have served long with the 21st, for in the same
year in which the Black Watch left America he was appointed “major
of brigade” to the forces in North America. It was probably during
the interval between the Seven Years’ War and the war with the
Americans that he began to acquire the property in Nova Scotia,
part of which he afterwards bequeathed to his cousin, John Reid.
We have some indication that during this period he interested
himself in local politics and formed the friendship of at least one
American which was of value to him later.

Small served throughout the War of Independence though but rare
glimpses are obtained of him. He was present as a brigade-major
at the battle of Bunker Hill, June 17, 1777, and in the course of
that day his life was saved by the American General Putnam, who,
seeing Small standing alone at a time when all around him had
fallen, struck up the barrels of his men’s muskets to save his
life. Shortly after this, Small raised the 2nd battalion of the
Royal Highland Regiment and was appointed major-commandant. In 1778
the regiment was numbered the 84th and in 1780 he was promoted
to lieutenant-colonel-commandant of his battalion. He is said to
have joined Sir Henry Clinton at New York in 1779, but it is more
probable that he was stationed for the most part in Nova Scotia. In
March, 1783, Small and his battalion were at Fort Edward, New York,
and in the following autumn the battalion was disbanded at Windsor,
Nova Scotia, where many of the men settled and formed the present
town of Douglas.

Small, once more on half-pay, returned home and in 1790 was
promoted colonel and three years later was appointed lieutenant
governor of Guernsey. In October, 1794, he became major-general and
on the 17th of March, 1796, he died in Guernsey and was buried in
the church of St. Peter Port.

General Stewart of Garth wrote of General John Small that “No
chief of former days ever more fairly secured the attachment
of his clan, and no chief, certainly, ever deserved it better.
With an enthusiastic and almost romantic love for his country
and countrymen, it seemed as if the principal object of his life
had been to serve them, and promote prosperity. Equally brave in
leading them in the field, and kind, just, and conciliating in
quarters, they would have indeed been ungrateful if they regarded
him otherwise than as they did. There was not an instance of
desertion in his battalion.”

_Thomas Stirling._

Thomas Stirling, second son of Sir Henry Stirling, of Ardoch, was
born October 8, 1731. He began his military career in the Dutch
service, being given a commission as ensign in the 1st Battalion
of Col. Marjoribanks’ Regiment on the 30th of September, 1747,
and was probably placed on half-pay when the establishment of the
Scots Brigade was reduced in 1752. On the 24th of July, 1757,
having been nominated by James, Duke of Atholl, and having raised
the requisite number of men, he was gazetted captain of one of
the three companies added to the 42nd in that year. In November,
1757, he sailed for America, where he served with his regiment in
the campaigns of the ensuing years, though he was not present at
the first attack on Ticonderoga, owing to the fact that the new
companies had been left behind to garrison Fort Edward. He took
part in the capture of Martinique in 1762 and was wounded but was
able to serve in the capture of Havana later in that year. He
returned with his regiment to America and in August, 1765, was sent
in command of a company to take possession of Fort de Chartes on
the Mississippi. After holding this fort that winter and spring,
he returned with his detachment to the regiment in June, 1766. The
following year the 42nd left America and for upwards of eight years
was quartered in Ireland, after which it was for a short time in
Scotland. In 1770 Stirling was gazetted major of the regiment, and
1771 lieutenant-Colonel-commandant. Hostilities broke out with the
Americans in 1775, and, Stirling, having in five months raised the
strength of his regiment from 350 men to 1,200, returned with it in
the following spring to America, where he commanded it continuously
for three years during the war. He took part in the engagement
at Brooklyn, the attack on Fort Washington, the expedition to
Pennsylvania, battle of Monmouth, and others. During 1778-9 he
was stationed at or near New York. In June, 1779, he accompanied
a force under General Mathews through New Jersey in an attempt to
rally the supposed loyalists of that state. This was unsuccessful
and ended in the destruction of the town of Springfield. General
Stirling was so severely wounded while leading the attack that he
could take no further part in the war. His thigh was broken and
fearing to be rendered incapable of further service he refused
to have it amputated. He recovered and was invalided home but he
does not appear after this to have been ever again fit for active
duty. In 1782 he was promoted major-general and appointed colonel
of the 71st Foot, but his regiment was disbanded the following
year. His services were rewarded with a baronetcy and in 1790,
he became colonel of the 41st Regiment. In 1796 he was promoted
lieutenant-general, and in 1799 he succeeded his brother in the
baronetcy of Ardock. He attained the rank of general in 1801 and
died unmarried on the 9th of May, 1808.


_Kenneth Tolmie._

Kenneth Tolmie was commissioned a lieutenant in the 42nd
Highlanders, 23rd January, 1756, and promoted to the Command of a
Company 27th July, 1760. His name is dropped after the Peace of
1763.

COLONEL ROGER TOWNSHEND.

Roger Townshend, fifth son of Charles Viscount Townshend, and
younger brother of Gen’l George Townshend (afterwards 4th Viscount
and 1st Marquis) to whom Quebec surrendered when Wolfe was killed,
was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel 1st Feb., 1758, and served as
Adjutant-General in the Expedition against Louisbourg, and Deputy
Adjutant-General in this Campaign with Rank of Colonel. He was
killed in the Trenches before Ticonderoga by a cannon ball on the
25th July, 1759, and his remains were transmitted to Albany for
interment. His spirit and military knowledge justly entitled him to
the esteem of every soldier; and accordingly the loss of him was
universally lamented.

Extract from a letter dated Albany, July 29, 1759.

  “The same evening (July 27), an Express arrived from Ticonderoga,
  with an account of Colonel Townshend being killed, in
  reconnoitering the Fort, by a cannon ball.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Yesterday about 12 o’clock, Colonel Townshend’s corpse arrived
  here, and was decently interred.”

In the “Church Book” St. Peter’s, Albany, appears the following
entry:

_The following is a copy of the inscription on the monument to Col.
Townshend in Westminster Abbey_

                   “This Monument was erected
                    By a disconsolate Parent
                 The Lady Viscountess Townshend
                 To the Memory of her Fifth Son
           The Hon’ble Lieut. Colonel Roger Townshend
                who was killed by a Cannon Ball
     on the 25th of July, 1759, in the 28th year of his age
    as he was reconnoitering ye French lines at Ticonderoga
                        In North America
           From the Parent the Brother and the Friend
                His sociable and amiable manners
                    His enterprizing Bravery
                 And the Integrity of His Heart
              May claim the tribute of affliction
                     Yet Stranger weep not
                  For tho’ premature His Death
                     His life was glorious
                  Enrolling Him with the names
           of those Immortal Statesmen and Commanders
                  Whose wisdom and Intrepidity
     In the course of this Comprehensive and Successful War
                   Have Extended the Commerce
            And upheld the Majesty of these Kingdoms
              Beyond the idea of any former age.”


[Illustration: Monument to Lieut. Colonel Roger Townshend in
Westminster Abbey (The Bayonet on Monument found on battlefield of
Ticonderoga and placed on memorial by Dean Stanley)]

_The following is an extract from a letter from the head verger of
Westminster Abbey_

  “I should like to draw your attention to the broken bayonet in
  the upper part of the Townshend monument. It is a relic of the
  struggle between the French and English in North America and it
  comes from Ticonderoga and may have been used in that particular
  ‘march to Ticonderoga, where Col. Townshend was killed.’ It was
  given to Dean Stanley when in America and he fixed it on the
  monument as he did the wreath of leaves on the monument of Major
  Andre.

  Lord Eversley, who when H. M. first Commissioner of Works was
  the Rt. Hon. J. G. Shaw Lefevre--is much struck by the Townshend
  inscription, especially the latter part, which, he has told me,
  is worthy of Edmund Burke and which I know he would like to
  attribute to that great orator and statesman.”

_TICONDEROGA_

Ticonderoga, familiar as the name of the historic fortress at Lake
George, was written by Sir William Johnson, in 1756, Tionderogue
and Ticonderoro, and in grant of lands in 1760, “near the fort at
Ticonderoga.” Gov. Colden wrote Ticontarogen, and an Iroquoian
sachem is credited with Decariaderoga. Interpretations are
almost as numerous as orthographies. The most generally quoted
is from Spofford’s Gazetter: “Ticonderoga, from Tsindrosie, or
Cheonderoga, signifying ‘brawling water,’ and the French name,
Carillon, signifying ‘a chime of bells,’ were both suggested by
the rapids upon the outlet of Lake George.” The French name may
have been so suggested, but neither Tsindrosie or Cheonderoga
means “brawling water.” The latter is probably an orthography of
Teonderoga. Ticonderoga as now written, is from Te or Ti, “dual,”
two; Kaniatare, “lake,” and -ogen, “intervallum, divisionem”
(Bruyas), the combination meaning, literally “Between two lakes.”
Horatio Hale wrote me of one of the forms “Dekariaderage, in modern
orthography, Tekaniataroken, from which Ticonderoga, means, simple
‘Between two lakes.’ It is derived from Tioken, ‘between,’ and
Kaniatara, ‘lake.’ Its composition illustrates a peculiar idiom
of the Iroquoian language. Tioken when combined with a noun,
is split in two, so to speak, and the noun inserted. Thus in
combining Tioken with Oneonte, ‘mountain,’ we have Ti-ononte-oken,
‘Between two mountains,’ which was the name of one of the Mohawk
castles--sometimes written Theonondioga. In like manner, Kaniatare,
‘lake,’ thus compounded, yields Te-kaniatare-oken, ‘Between two
lakes.’ In the Huron dialect Kiniatare is contracted to Yontare
or Ontare, from which, with io or iyo, ‘great,’ we get Ontario
(pronounced Ontareeyo), ‘Great lake,’ which combined with Tioken,
becomes Tionteroken, which would seem to be the original of
Colden’s Ticonderoga.”

TESTIMONIALS TO THE BLACK WATCH.

The Virginia Gazette, July 30, 1767, published an article from
which the following extracts have been taken:

  “Last Sunday evening, the Royal Highland Regiment embarked from
  Philadelphia for Ireland, which regiment, since its arrival in
  America, had been distinguished for having undergone most amazing
  fatigues, made long and frequent marches through an unhospitable
  country, bearing excessive heat and severe cold with alacrity
  and cheerfulness, frequently encamping in deep snow, such as
  those who inhabit the interior parts of this province do not
  see, and which only those who inhabit the most northern parts
  of Europe can have any idea of, continually exposed in camp and
  on their marches to the alarms of a savage enemy, who, in all
  their attempts, were forced to fly. * * * And, in a particular
  manner, the free-men of this and the neighboring provinces have
  most sincerely to thank them for that resolution and bravery
  with which they, under Colonel Boquet, and a small number of
  Royal Americans, defeated the enemy, and ensured to us peace and
  security from a savage foe; and, along with our blessings for
  these benefits, they have our thanks for that decorum in behavior
  which they maintained during their stay in this city, giving an
  example that the most amiable behavior in civil life is no way
  inconsistent with the character of the good soldier; and for
  their loyalty, fidelity, and orderly behavior, they have every
  wish of the people for health, honor, and a pleasant voyage.”

       *       *       *       *       *

Extract from speech by the elder Pitt in vindication of the
employment of Highland Regiments of which the Black Watch was the
first raised of the eighty-six during the four wars between 1739
and 1815.

  “I sought for merit wherever it was to be found; it is my boast
  that I was the first Minister who looked for it and found it in
  the mountains of the North. I called it forth and drew into your
  service a hardy and intrepid race of men, who, when left by your
  jealousy, became a prey to the artifice of your enemies, and had
  gone nigh to have overturned the State in the war before the
  last. These men in the last war were brought to combat on your
  side, they served with fidelity as they fought with valour, and
  conquered for you in every part of the world.”

THE BLACK WATCH MEMORIAL AT TICONDEROGA.

The genesis of this memorial was an address made by the late Joseph
Cook at the services held in front of the boulder erected to the
heroes of Ticonderoga, Academy Park, Ticonderoga, N. Y. July 31,
1899, in which he made this remark: “There ought to be a memorial
to the Black Watch composed largely of Scotch Highlanders who,
with the Colonials charged Montcalm’s entrenchments for eight
consecutive hours.”

[Illustration: Major D. L. Wilson Farquharson, D. S. O., at

Representation of the Black Watch at Unveiling of Memorial Tablet,
Ticonderoga, July 4, 1906]

The writer, who was secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical Society
at that time, had the honor of being the medium through which this
chance remark became an enduring memorial of brick and stone. He
was unsuccessful, however, until Mr. David Williams, the publisher
of “The Iron Age,” a summer resident of Ticonderoga at Rogers
Rock, came to his assistance. Mr. Andrew Carnegie was the generous
donor of the funds to build this memorial. The grants were in
two amounts, the first gift for a public library with the usual
provisions, and the second gift, with no limitations, with which to
build an historical addition to the library, thus making it both a
public library and historical building.

The laying of the corner stone, Oct. 4. 1905, was made the occasion
for one of the greatest celebrations Ticonderoga has ever seen.
The pipe band of the 5th Royal Scots of Canada, Highlanders,
now the 5th Royal Highlanders of Canada, from Montreal, and the
Regimental band and a Battalion of the 5th Infantry, U. S. A., from
Plattsburgh, were the principal features of the parade. It was
particularly appropriate that the Royal Scots should be present, as
they are allied to the Black Watch and wear the same uniform. It
was also an education to the thousands of spectators, few, if any
of whom had ever seen Highlanders in full regimentals marching to
the music of bagpipes. After the exercises of the day, the Royal
Scots visited the ruins of old Fort Ticonderoga, about two miles
from the village and the picture of a body of Highlanders with
their scarlet coats and tartan kilts marching up the green slopes
of the old ramparts, with the setting sun behind them, was one
never to be forgotten and which probably had not occurred since the
Revolution.

The officers of the present Black Watch Regiment, then stationed
at Fort George Scotland, being advised of the Memorial sent the
following letter to the secretary of the Ticonderoga Historical
Society:

  “Dear Sir: Your letter 9th Sept., 1905, on the subject of a Black
  Watch Memorial, has been perused by the Commanding Officer and
  the Officers of the 1st battalion of The Black Watch, formerly
  called the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment, and it was also
  submitted and discussed at the Annual Gathering of Black Watch
  Officers--past and present--recently held in Edinburgh. I am
  authorized to inform you that all Ranks of the Regiment are proud
  to know that the Ticonderoga Historical Society had decided to
  appropriate an alcove in the Ticonderoga Free Public Library as
  a memorial to the 42nd Regiment, to commemorate their services
  in the engagement before Fort Ticonderoga on July 8, 1758. The
  suggestion contained in your letter, to the effect that Officers
  of the Regiment might be disposed to erect a tablet on a wall of
  the Alcove to the memory of the officers and men of the 42nd who
  were killed or wounded in the action has met with the unanimous
  approval of those to whose notice it has been brought, and I am
  to inform you that such a Tablet will gladly be provided and that
  the work of executing the Tablet will be entrusted to a London
  firm as soon as a suitable design has been decided upon. In order
  to assist us in choosing a suitable form of tablet I shall be
  much obliged if you can favor me with a rough plan of the alcove,
  the dimensions of the actual wall on which the Tablet will rest,
  and an idea of the general style of the building.

  I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as you can conveniently
  supply the information for which I have asked.

      I am, Sir, yours truly,

      D. L. Wilson Farquharson.
      Major The Black Watch.”

The exercises for the unveiling of the memorial tablet July 4,
1906, was made the occasion for another grand celebration at which
the full bag pipe band of the 5th Royal Highlanders of Canada and
a company of 50 men from the same regiment, making a total of 75
Highlanders, were a feature of the parade. Major D. L. Wilson
Farquharson of the Black Watch, came over from Scotland to unveil
the tablet in behalf of the Regiment. It was accepted by Frank B.
Wickes of Ticonderoga for the Ticonderoga Historical Society. The
address of the day was delivered by Senator Edgar T. Brackett of
Saratoga Springs.

January 6, 1814, was deputy quartermaster under his brother and
was member of Congress from Albany District from 1794 to 1802.

they take the posts, on the Mohawk River, etc. See Appendix.

[23] Some of the names in the two preceding letters from Capt.
Campbell are interesting because they illustrate the Scottish
custom of using name of estate rather than the family or given
name. This was often necessary to distinguish between several of
same name.

Captain Stratchur is Captain John Campbell of Stratchur, there are
also John Campbells of Duneavis, and of Glendaruel. Archie Sherreff
is Lieut. Archibald Campbell, son of the Sheriff of Argyle. Duchra
is Capt. Thomas Graeme of Duchray. George and “the Major” are sons
of John Campbell of Barcaldine--George Campbell was appointed
Ensign in the 42d in 1756, promoted Lieut, in Gage’s Regiment 1757,
and killed at Havana 1762. “The Major” was Alexander Campbell,
Major in the 77th (Montgomery Highlanders). Unkle Corries is John
Campbell of Corries and his son Colin was evidently at the massacre
at Fort William Henry in August 1757. Fort du Quesne was the French
fort at what is now Pittsburgh.

  block, for example after ‘Lossing writes,’ on page 20.

  The original blank cells in the table in Appendix F have been given
  a dash (-) in this etext for clarity.

  In Appendix P information about the ‘2nd Batt.’ of a regiment was
  sometimes on a separate line. For consistency all regimental info is
  in one paragraph in this etext.

  The original text used three asterisks (* * *) to indicate missing
  or skipped words, but sometimes used two or four or five. For
  consistency the etext always uses three. On page 80 an ellipsis is
  used (twice) instead of asterisks in both the original and the etext.

  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
  the text and consultation of external sources.

  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.

  Pg 8: ‘wha had a passage’ replaced by ‘who had a passage’.
  Pg 14: ‘your memoralist humbly’ replaced by ‘your memorialist humbly’.
  Pg 16: ‘on Ticonderogt’ replaced by ‘on Ticonderoga’.

  Pg 35: ‘of the Westtern’ replaced by ‘of the Western’.
  Pg 35: ‘no knowlodge’ replaced by ‘no knowledge’.
  Pg 39: ‘* * *’ indicates missing words or letters; it was blank
  space in the original book (due to an edge of the original
  source letter being torn off).
  Pg 57: ‘1893-95 Flanders’ replaced by ‘1793-95 Flanders’.
  Pg 58: ‘The Spinx’ replaced by ‘The Sphinx’.
  Pg 62: ‘Parkmen mentions’ replaced by ‘Parkman mentions’.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
